mrca article sniperz thanks for your comments on my edits i added some part about mirage being the original mrca in the indian air force article but frankly speaking i think that there is no need at all for a separate mrca article although it is very large its just another military contract in my opinion contracts and tenders might not deserve separate articles but can have large sections describing them thanks',0
arguing that bart and caltrain should get more money by virtue of the fact that they are rail systems may be arguing against costeffectiveness but it is still a valid argument costeffectiveness is not the beall endall bart and ac transit serve different functions and their funding levels reflect that no bus service could take the place of bart so it seems foolish to hold them up to the same funding standards that is all i meant',0

georgi kinkladze i took the article to fac twice in and the first attempt failed through a number of assorted minor issues such as an image that took an age to clear through otrs the second fac did not get much traffic and while noone opposed it it only gained one support in its month on the fac page i have barely been onwiki in the past few months but i would gladly take on board any suggestions you have to improve the article further',0

wait a second buddy you wanted to edit war to insert this that there are differences in intellectual attainment between racially distinct populations is not disputed however the modern scientific conception of race which shows that there is more genetic variation within than between race groups casts doubt on the basis of these results which was unsourced is not relevant to the phenomenon in question and does not even make sense please stop trying to cover your ass your pants are down and we all saw \xe2\x80\x94preceding unsigned comment added by',0

whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well many readers will come to this page read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section without differentiating in a small way my two points we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole it is a defect of this article that it talks too much about \xe2\x80\x9ccures\xe2\x80\x9d which indeed gives a biased view the controversy section is best kept short as there is a main article i agree the controversy section is best kept short not incorrectly biased and lacking information as it currently stands the controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise that is all there is to it your anaolgy is about as crass as saying oh look theres a dead body there lets use it for fertilizer after all its dead whilst you might not agree with that analogy it is roughly how many people would view your point your opinion whilst well informed is not any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system and thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue as a side note some people covers a large portion of the people on this planet no because those embryos really do end in trash cans whatever the whish of the family be this is the general rule whereas found bodies end up in the morgue then are incinerated if not claimed and the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case it might seem crass to say so but it is still the truth stem cell research should be legalized everywhere what would happen to people if they had any of their body part burned or worse stem cell research could help grow a new one based on the persons dna et all and reattach back to the body the wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reject it because it wont be foreign to it replace the whole page considering how badly written this article is i suggest we simply copy the entire article from httpencitizendiumorgwikistemcell to here \xe2\x80\x94preceding unsigned comment added by i do not think we can afaik the creative commons sharealike licenses are not compatible with the gfdl h g bob talk hmm for some reason why are people for and agasit stem cell researchit confuses mewhat benifits are thereand are there any downsides key stem cell research events i would like to add the following information to the key stem cell research events section january publication of the neural colonyforming cell ncfc assay as a simple assay to enumerate neural stem cells importantly the assay allows discrimination between neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells i dont consider the march key event to be so notable given that it was only shown in one individual and has not been replicated since march the first published study of successful cartilage regeneration in the human knee using autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells is published by clinicians from regenerative sciences added el i have added an el ethics of stem cell research as it is from the wellknown stanford encyclopedia of philosophy there should not be any problems with this addition hi this is wrong january under the new president barack obama the restrictions placed on federal funding of stem cell research in t',0
nightwish metal ganres and metal music this is mainly in concern to your post on the nightwish page please do not take this in any way shape or form as an attack but more as a offer of guidance i highly suggest that when you read an article you read it thoroughly if you are unsure of the meaning of something follow the link associated with it and read the article about it if a link is not provided a good dictionary site such as this one should help in relevance to nightwish is musical style they are not gothic for reasons why i suggest you read the articles symphonic metal and gothic metal in relevance to metal genre pages and metal bands in genre there is often discussion upon things to do with these but low and behold please be assured there is a dedicated network of users who work on this musical form and the bands within who are all highly experienced in the topic and all work with and sometimes against each other to make the articles the best they can be please feel free to join any discussion on any page but please read through previous disscussions to see why the comments currently made are being made hope you fair well and thank you for the time taken to comment on nightwish is current talk page',0
copy of mail just sent to the wikieni list in answer to the point of no legal threats the legal reference was to the fact that i was being threatened with various forms of complaint that would need defending against by the aff couple at the same time as the block began thus obstructing my actions i do not see that as a legal threat to sue anyone the point is one should not have personal feuds from outside wikipedia brought into it and if any harrassment that would be a wrong in the world outside wikipedia had been effected during the block which it had blocked me responding to then that clearly would have been a legal wrong because wikipedia can not opt out of the world it is not isolated from the existence of those factors in society as a whole egin the argument about nazism that is going on here you are taking a position against having nazis target groups put in danger and you are doing that because it is an outside world legal issue wikipedia is not a democracy needs quite a sharp answer given to it for the reason of keeping itself in passably right relationship with the outside world iereaders wikipedia holds a policy on neutrality of content but the only way this policy genuinely exists and is not a lie to readers is if unconditionally anyone who falls victim to crowd psychology can lay claim to by right not have to beg for by favour any measure that prevents a force of group numbers keeping a bullying bias in place without having to find npov ground now laying claim to anything inherently means being entitled to anything this is actually a casestudy in how society emerged from the middle ages to have any credible claim to work by any principles a society must show they operate reliably fairly and to do that means that people are entitled to it no way out of that hence as soon as any group tries to follow any policy code like neutral pov immediately people are entitled to things and all things are not dependent on favour so it stands absolutely logically proved either it is wrong to say to any user ever you arenot entitled to anything or it is wrong to say to the public that wikipedia has a neutrality policy that worksthey can not both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other headon at least one must be wrong which is itend of copy right what this means is perfectly clear unless wikipedia can answer the question i put there which is it then wikipedia is illegal it is as simple as that and i am immediately posting so in every single aspie forum i belong to i will also be asking reallife organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign the illegality is shared by every person who does not leave wikipedia unless there is an unless unless the question is answerable there are only answers if it is the second answer no neutrality policy then wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down while if it is the first answer the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things then this block ends it is as simple as that now i have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge the block forms part of a groupbullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge and if that is not the case wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things and that inherently means it is not a legal threat to say so that means being entitled to challenge any admin who claims it is now people outside wikipedia are going to see whether this has been passed on to every place for challenging blocks and then what answers it gets',0

don\xc2\xb4t hide correct information instead help people get access to it hi tournesol wikipedia have never been about consensus wikipedia is about making new correct and useful information public for a brooder amount of people quicker and within a shorter time interval than ordinary dictionaries this means researchers with a specific knowledge may help other people get access to it and speedup the expansion of the world mainstream knowledge i think you agree it\xc2\xb4s a god deed to share information even if this knowledge is regarded new for the ordinary layman and in the forefront of science wikipedia has never been about satisfying some perverse peoples needs to act as deputies for bureaucratic hegemonies for example it will be impossible to incorporate pictures in wikipedia if you can\xe2\x80\x99t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures and do you tournesol really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn\xe2\x80\x99t based on his or her own knowledge including research',0

barling bomber xnbl would be fine with me as the important thing here is that most researchers will be looking for the words barling bomber in the article is title shame on you the wpairnc is not a standard that article titles are forced to conform with it is only the suggested method of naming this particular aircraft conforms to the same convention applied to the horten ho article in the case of experimental aircraft it is often more correct to name the aircraft after the designer not the manufacturer in this particular case that is doubly true as the manufacturer went out of buisness before the aircraft was operational and the designer continued to design aircraft for another decade',0

i never said they would be expelled i said they do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout the only way an avowed homosexual can both understand and agree to live by the scout oath and law is to lie of course he is also violating his promise to be trustworthy in the process he does not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout he intentionally violates the scout oath and law and he intents to continue violating the scout oath and law but he could join and remain in scouting nonetheless by telling lies i imagine at any given time there are thousands of scouts who are regularly violating the scout oath and law who intend to continue doing so and still remain in scouts but that does not change the fact the scout oath is what it is that bsa believes that homosexual behavior violates the scout oath and that these scouts are not qualified to be scouts the first amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group is policy to be expressive association the courts may not interfere on the ground that they view a particular expression as unwise or irrational and beliefs need not be acceptable logical consistent or comprehensible to others to merit first amendment protection the fact that many scouts disagree with bsa beliefs ignore bsa beliefs disobey bsa beliefs or that anyone finds bsa beliefs to be inconsistent irrational or unwise does not take away bsa is right to assert and hold their beliefs',0

i was probably in bad mode that day do not take it seriously however there is still question why most of the wikipedia edits of one swedish are about kosovo my logic tell me that something is wrong there and i just do not like much when people lie about their identity but if you are swedish then you should be more cautious about edits in one such sensitive question such as kosovo the fact that albanians from kosovo want independence does not mean that you should reject some scientific principles and to post into these articles maps whose only purpose is to remind albanians that they once lived in the countries which enslaved them i am serb but i fully understand kosovar albanian point of view regarding serbia as for these maps i wrote that to you in serbian but i will repeat that in english if you write about one territory then you should post there only maps which show that territory with its own borders two maps that you posted do not comply with this principle if any of these two actually showed metohija with its borders within serbiamontenegro or montenegro i would not object but to post only maps of these two countries with no borders of metohija shown is not a science at all talk',0

another point to be examined regarding the controversial interpretations of the ny times story is the interpretation of this key paragraph where picard is name is mentioned along with two other scientists the unspoken and unexamined implication or assumption in the disputed section of this biography is that scientists such as tour picard and skell are accurately described by the di is claim that they are antievolution dissenters from darwin and also supporters of the di is political agenda deserving negative publicity for taking such a laughable position did chang intentionally put that paragraph into his story to affirm the di is characterization of those three scientists or did chang put that paragragraph into the story to cast doubt in the reader is mind on the di is incredulous claim that all signers adhered to the di is characterization of the signers given that chang reported both the di is claims and the string of quotes revealing a mix of support and disdain among the petition signers a neutral point of view requires that anyone reading chang is article with a critical eye would ask the obvious question is the reader supposed to take at face value the di is naked claim that scientists such as those three are antievolution dissenters from darwin who support the di is political agenda or is the reader supposed to take that paragragh as startling evidence that the claims of the di stretch credulity the way the article is written a casual reader could draw either conclusion a skeptical or fairminded reader could also draw the conclusion that no firm conclusion can be drawn as to whether any of the signers fit the di is characterization of them as antievolution dissenters from darwin who support the di is political agenda what conclusion did the various wikipedia editors draw and how do they justify treating any such conclusion as an established fact for the purpose of crafting authentic biographies of figures such as tour picard or skell',0

what you say is all well and good but there is a catch it only applies is the person being persecuted is in fact being persecuted for bogus reasons remove much of the sniping and the slander and the pedophilia accusatories and you find that will is tenure as an admin was more exemplified by his rash decisions followed by abuse of admin powers to back up his decisions having personally been on the receiving end of his do not argue with me or i will ban you style of administration it is clear that he simply was not mature enough to be given such responsibilities period but who knows maybe when he matures he will use the experience properly and return to help out wikipedia one day in a far more constructive capacity i will not hold my breath but again who knows he might surprise all of us',0

unnecessary mediation at broken flowers chris i am not knowledgeable about mediation arbitration and such things but it seems to me that the current mediation at broken flowers is unnecessary considering that it is between an anonymous ip who keeps inserting his own private original research essay into the article even after being told not to by the mediator and another editor simply trying to revert it the ip also has posted direct personal insults to the other editor on the talk page and in his edit summaries it seems to me that this is not something that deserves mediation it just needs an admin to nip it in the bud can you take a look',0

some of this discussion seems to have gotten a little heated but i think the main goal remains the same of having a good encylopedia and having good articles within it the subjects involved both mhfm and the others mentioned may seem obscure to the general reader but are figures of note within the theologicalphilsophical schools of which they represent the sedevacantist position is of serious interest to those studying the ramifications of vatican ii on the largest single religious denomination on the planet and stands as a serious challenge to those who accept vatican ii and those who refuse and resist it such as the society of saint pius x but still hold that francis is a legitimate pope despite his endorsement of vatican ii due to the sedevacantist rejection of contempory vatican authority it makes sense that there are competing schools within this segment of post vatican ii catholicism and in a culture obsessed with concerns such as what will amanda bynes tweet next it stands to reason that they are paying much attention to debates over things like the rubrics of the tridentine rite but it would be a disserve to the goal of the encyclopedia to ignore these intellectual schools of thought surely if wikipedia can have an article on every piece of music made by paris hilton we can find a way to capture the interactions and debates between schools of thought that will continue for generations to come it is wikipedia practice to use a person is published thoughts as a legitimate source that can be cited as a quotation about that person is opinionie a person is tweets can be quoted in that person is wikiarticle citing the twitter page is url even though they are were not printed in full by a media organization it would seem that such an approach could be used here citing ibranyi by quoting his online work as an indication of his own thought as long as an encylopedic manner was maintained',0

re silent films by some virtue i have been addressing errors in the historical record and submitting corrections to different venues for all matter of silent film works i am liking how later productions by most companies have plenty of images and background works to go by as long as errors like this exist i will have to be on my toes i am sure you know the whole verifiability not truth and no original research but some original research quickly clears up such errors and shows how prevalent they are in almost all topics so much of that film still is totally wrong it is robert mcwade in the vitagraph production zoom in if you do not believe me i have actually submitted several other film still identifications but i do not want to be a pain most people know wikipedia is not infallible but most people do not understand that so many books and other sources are also very flawed only thanhouser films left to go oh yes you have to be very careful even otherwise reliable sources get it wrong\xe2\x99\xa6',0

breton and picasso your clarification was in order and i thank for that breton was indeed a trotskyist and a bitter enemy of stalin as you said this helps to explain his remark to picasso i would make one correction breton was a trotskyist from the wikipedia website httpenwikipediaorgwikitrotskyism in france of the electorate voted in for parties calling themselves trotskyist my emphasis i do not think the trotskyite spelling occurs anywhere this wikipedia page trotskyist is used throughout and establishes it as the accepted spelling the same wiki site says today in the english language an advocate of trotsky is ideas is usually called a trotskyist while trotskyism is opponents usually refer to them pejoratively as a trotskyite or trot in the same way one is a stalinist not a stalinite whether one likes or dislikes stalin advocate or not let is not use any terms that have a desparaging tone i know you did not mean it as such i used trotskyite myself for many years let is use trotskyist if only for the sake of consistencymysweetoldetc',0

ec with marskell ottava you seem to be very upset about this and i am really clueless as to why and why you hold this position about npov and consensus using your reasoning we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive then it must be fac is entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines in other words consensus can change i do think that the rcc page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong pov that is understandable people usually work on topics they are passionate about either for or against i fully acknowledge and praise that they are trying to make the article as npov as possible but when you hold a strong pov sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is that is why processes like fac gan and pr are essential because then you can get hopefully the opinions of people who do not hold a strong pov on the topic i would encourage you to post at wtfac to see what the consensus is for how to review an article are npov and comprehensiveness concerns offlimits or perhaps it would be useful to post at wtnpov to see whether there is consensus for your view that npov is decided solely by consensus please let me know if you initiate a discussion as i would like to participate',0
totally irrelevant egodriven drivel and for the record no this is not a personal attack just an observation on the total pointlessness of this entry maybe we should all put our cv is on wikipedia but i thought that wiki was attempting to become a credible medium of encyclopeadic information on the internet not for selfpublicity seeking ego merchants to paste up their life story and that of their woefully unspectacular personal and family histories this entire entry is no more suitable for a page than my life is contribution to the study of ethiopianstyles of ballroom dancing it belongs on a wiki personal page and no more considering that my family tree can be traced to before the norman invasion of england and i hold an hereditary title which was once owned by elizabeth i and francis bacon maybe i could start posting up my little life story and my gggggggggggggguncles and ggggggggggggggranddaddies and which castles they built etc yawn but there again i am not a vain egotistical numpty who wants to use wikipedia as an online cv service i do wonder if the cryptoconsultancy industry needs a few heads at the moment hmmmmmmmmmm i only mention dear old lizzie the first and nick bacon as they have actually been heard of by most people not becuase i wish to pump up my ego in fact the title was grabbed by liz after the reformation so it was not all that good news for us after all and certainly not something to be gloating about there are loads of unsubstantiated claims in this article including stats about website hits compared to the cia oh yeah come off it d i think the german wikipedians have got it about right does not warrant inclusion meanwhile i will carry on editing the topics that i do know about templar history aviation and erm maybe a bit of medieval history too and i will not try to be all things to all people in offering my omnipotent edits on a variety of subjects that i only know a very little unlike some of the people on here maybe it is just an attempt to get edit counts ever higher to make oneself look incredibly intelligent and important and then get supported by all our colleagues from work and our own selfcreated cryptosociety members etc to come to our defence when we need them ps by the way my mother is scottish line is distantly related to alan bean your esteemed astronaut who was the fourth man on the moon but i do not hold it against him a good chap now just where did i put that can of antiego spray',0

the criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed the criticism section is fundamentally and appallingly flawed for example it starts off by quoting and uses heavily throughout the white supremacist tomislav suni\xc4\x87 who other people may think of as a reliable source but i most certainly do not here are his thoughts on jews i hope you have a stronger stomach for that filth than i do i stopped reading about halfway down more about suni\xc4\x87 in june the group hosted tomislav sunic a former croatian diplomat and the author of the antisemitic book homo americanus child of the postmodern age which argues that americanism heavily influenced by judaism undermines traditional european morality on june about people attended a talk by pacifica forum speaker tomislav sunic who only three days earlier had addressed the white supremacist council of conservative citizens ccc at its national leadership conference in sheffield ala sunic a writer and white nationalist had previously spoken to the washington dcarea chapter of the ccc and the institute for historical review at least twice he appeared on the political cesspool a white nationalist radio show and was interviewed extensively for david duke is internet radio program sunic and the former klan boss whose latest book is entitled jewish supremacism my awakening to the jewish question commiserated about jewish domination low birth rates among people of european ancestry and discrimination against whites especially in these multiracial cities like la or washington dc i am losing my eye contact sunic confessed to duke i am sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because i know they may not be of my species the criticism section also relies heavily on rummel about whom we should maintain a high degree of scepticism to quote tomislav duli\xc4\x87 the estimates used by rummel for tito\xe2\x80\x99s yugoslavia cannot be relied upon since they are largely based on hearsay and unscholarly claims frequently made by highly biased authors it then goes on to say that the commission on concealed mass graves in slovenia an office of the slovenian government whose task is to find and document mass grave sites from the second world war and the period immediately after it discovered at least mass graves in the slovenian territories which \xe2\x80\x9care believed to hold up to bodies\xe2\x80\x9d killed under tito is government none of this is true the ccmgs has compiled a list of sites which it believes worthy of inspection under the terms of its mandate it has investigated just a few of these and even where it has started to investigate progress has been slow to say the least for example at tezno bodies were discovered in despite the wild speculation by the likes of de\xc5\xbeman and ferenc about bodies so eagerly reported in the media and at barbara rov bodies that is not to say how many bodies will eventually be found nobody knows but what the article currently says is absolutely untrue finally it gives mention to bernard meares of whom i have no criticism i am sure he is a fine man but is he the best you can do he has lived in trieste for some years as a translator of the cern institute of geneva wow there is not much else in the criticism section unless you lot can come up with better than this in terms of sources then it should be removed',0

your edits to marcus hahnemann okay examples for the piping of club names check any other football bio page eg theo walcott brian mcbride wayne rooney alan shearer for the formatting of dates in the infobox check the guidelines at template talkinfobox football biography you should be using five tildes ie to produce the timestamp for your other edit how does english fa premier league even make sense either call it the english premier league or call it the fa premier league but to call it both in the same sentence is nonsensical please do some research in future before trying to change the style on an article for the piping the convention is meaningless as the name of the club includes the initials the fact that some other articles use your conventions does not mean anything other articles use mine so it is a matter of meaning and i still think mine has more sense for adding the hour and minute of the update of scores i think it is useless but if your template talk says so i do not agree with you english fa premier league makes sense as the league is the fa premier league and guess it is english as regards your suggestion i suggest you to be less arrogant in your messages to other editors particulary when you are wrong',0

potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms as stated in the present version of the article these are mostly useful in mechanics based on the fact that a photon has no mass the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation i must say i agree with andries also this article is part of an encyclopedia why should it be limited to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and i see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic i like the work done by bensaccount but i think it needs to be elaborated electrical energy for example has both forms of potential and kinetic energies according to principles of science the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy chemical energy heat energy sound energy compressional waves light energy electromagnetic radiation electrical energy and nuclear energy i think if someone would like to expand on these it would be benificial to everyone louis may',0

mathematicians hired to monitor transactions i removed the following part of the article businessdk reported that the bank has a team of mathematicians employed to surveil the clients trading patterns saxo bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians economists and even physicists to a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity furthermore the secret source in the businessdk article referenced claims that saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns in order to take unfair advantage of customers however and this is not stated in the businessdk article saxo shows the same twosided price for the same amount at the same time to any and all clients trading this means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest therefore the accusation in the businessdk article is not only wrong but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it the fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information in relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians therefore the article is in my opinion an unreliable source in accordance with the wikipedia principles of wpirs either this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions and regarding saxo showing the twosided price etc should be included which i originally did until it was removed to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious and correct the mistaken information in the businessdk article or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely to preserve the neutrality of the article',0
removed the following which had no place and no reason to be in an encyclopedia article and which could be taken as a personal attack account of kinky sexual liaison in in harlan ellison recounted as if telling a factual story how in he had ended a consensual sexual encounter after tying his partner in the livingroom of her parents house so that she was naked and unable to move or release herself by leaving her there to be discovered by her parents the veracity of his own account cannot be determined it resembles a common urban legend also changed subtitle that may have been legally actionable and was undoubtedly a personal attack it was put up november reverted november and has been there until now look for this abuse to return soon facts are stubborn comments the us federal government is definition of sexual assault includes inappropriate touching see ellison is sexual assault on willis at the hugo awards is thoroughly documented to an unusual extent for any encyclopedia to use correct terminology for an event that is completely verifiable is certainly not actionable the first of the three most important things anecdote was retitled by an anon editor who objected to having ellison is selfdescribed behavior referred to as sexual assault i put it back in because it is sourced as well as any of the other controversies and is certainly notable ellison not only published the anecdote he told but is reported to have recounted it several times at conventions provided it is from a reliable sourced it is and we make it clear it is veracity is uncertain we do there are only two other issues is it sufficiently noteable appears to be but can not say for sure and is it documented as controversial no clear info on this the fact that you and i may think it is controversial is irrelevant if it is not documented as controversial given it is noteability there might be merit to include it somewhere else if it is not documented as controversial but not in the controversies section will try to find documentation of controversy what controversy i am aware of occurred exclusively in fandom which tends not to be documented up to wikipedia standards deleted portion had nothing to do with connie willis incident it was the quoted section from his essay pointless with a title that amounts to a personal attack it came back it has been removed again please do not turn this into an edit war but consider why you feel the need to hate mr ellison and to continual find ways to attack him in an encyclopedia facts are stubborn comments please remember assume good faith accusations that wiki editors include information in biographies based on personal animosity towards the subject is hardly an assumption of good faith this anecdote is directly sourced to ellison it may or may not to be true but not only did he repeat it at several conventions he also published it under his own name as something he had done it is therefore quite literally a selfincriminating account of a sexual assault ellison carried out or said he did in the argument has been made that this is not controversial and therefore ought to be under a different section i cannot however see any good reason to remove it altogether though as you will see other anecdotes that are not sourced have been removed i can still see no reason that this incident should even be in an encyclopedia even a selflabeled one use of the inflammatory label sexual assault appears to meet standard of personal attack and if it cannot be supported in its legal meaning it is actionable i also do not see why that particular terminology is so important when there are other terms that would not look like personal attack could easily be substituted the insistance on the use of the term assult is my reason for not being able to assume good faith aside as',0

let is put it this way flo everyone has talked past me here for months it is absolutely frustrating to have everything i contribute get labeled as disruptive disruptive how tedentious how i sure as heck do not feel that i have done so because as far as i am concerned i have acted in good faith trying to make wikipedia the best it can be if you want to explain the rules to me and how i can be who i am on wikipedia and stay within the rules i am all ears i just want fm to leave me alone how would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation if you have done such a good job explaining everything to me then why do i feel that i have been ganged up on without just cause i know a lot of people who feel that wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that is not very positive why not listen to me what do you all have to lose my faith is the core of my being and it is who i am do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to wikipedia have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules do you care how ordinary readers view wikipedia you probably do or else you would not be here the fact is traditionally minded christians number over billion people on this planet and close to million in the united states alone that is not some tiny crackpot minority out there if i feel attacked by wikipedia or feel that my pov is misrepresented how do you think they feel reading wikipedia let is face it here factually the perspective represented in the articles in the dominionism series from my perspective seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the united states regarding the christian right why should my work be reversed when i elaborate on the dominionist is pov which btw i do not agree with for the sake of ensuring fairness or when fm removes something i wrote from a reputable evangelical ministry critical of christian reconstructionist theology he tells me it is false or that i am pov pushing how i cited the sources which are widely respected in evangelical circles what am i supposed to think when s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the christian right who by the way are a minority of the total american population bush won twice because of their support and elected the gop to congress and a majority of the statehouses katherine yurica is and theocracywatch is pov represents a minority of the population i have no idea where you live perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends but they do not represent the larger picture how is writing from the majority perspective pov pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective considering it is the perspective of just a little over percent of the american population i suggested banning partisanship as part of the npov rule and consensus rule but feloniousmonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor when he does that what am i supposed to think about his motives i do not know him and he has not exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one have you ever stopped to think it is not what you say but how you say it the tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive and what am i supposed to think other than what i have said ad nauseam i feel attacked not consulted with so far i feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack things like wppov wppoint etc that get put up when i feel that i have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of could you consider rephrasing it this way or this is how you should be doing this that is constructive in my view instead of hurling rules at me the interpretations of which i disagree with tell me why you think i stepped over the line and your rationale i react positively to reasoned explanations not summary reversals of my work accusations of pov pushing etc without explanation maybe you have been at this for awhile so you take things for granted i simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from interpretation my friend i want to understand your interpretation and why you interpret the rules the way you do every time i do anything from asking people what they think about the rules or my ideas for improving wikipedia i get written up on this rfc flo please do not take this personally percent of the time i simply forget to login not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging',0

objectivity of circumcision article should be flagged due to gilgal fellows on salary who patrol edit the article as a matter of curiosity as a matter of curiosity if a person with a circumcision fetish found his way to this article would they be allowed to edit it as an authentic observer by the way the circumcision in front of the grass hut on page of the who pamphlet global trends would indicate that the purported hiv protection targets village people who live in primitive conditions would that also target the englishspeaking readers of a wiki site like wikipedia anyone ever hear of an educational foundation known as the gilgal fellows perhaps an entry in this article could describe their work joe circus talk unfortunately it appears anyone may edit the article regardless of a conflict of interest i have also questioned the relevance and impact of third world african hiv studies on our modern audience to no avail garycompugeek talk thanks for the link to a conflict of interest since there are a number of fellows who edit this article it would be helpful to know if any of them have information about the gilgal fellows described here it could be revelatory for circumcision wikipedia to include a section on the gilgal fellows who apparently have quite a mission it is my understanding that gilgal is an obscure word for mountain of burning foreskins joe circus talk no one having objected to the proposed sections on circumcision fetish and the gilgal fellows i will assume a consensus delegate the research and get back here with it asap joe circus talk it is impossible to assess such a vague proposal if you provide some specific sourced content we can assess its suitability jakew talk we can assess now would that be the royal we or you claim to speak for other fellows joe circus talk we refers to myself and others who may be interested in evaluating the proposal jakew talk all the same i do not get why you in particular deigned to represent the other fellows without asking their permission it will take a lot of human resources to put these sections together and if the consensus is already fixed in advance what is the point joe circus talk perhaps it is a little presumptuous but it is realistic it is usually a safe bet that more than one person will comment on a proposed change take a look at the archives if you want to confirm that for yourself as for your proposals previous discussions have found that there are no reliable sources discussing a circumcision fetish searching google scholar for gilgal society indicates that there are no reliable secondary sources regarding that subject either so i would think it doubtful that content could be written in a way that conforms to our policies jakew talk our policies you mean the gilgal fellows i am not certain who you are representing here joe circus talk wikipedia is policies obviously jakew talk another reader deleted this interesting discussion for some reason in trying to improve the circumcision article it is important that we discern between authentic readers and those who are paid a salary to patrol and manage this article that is not a personal attack nor a lack of presumption of good will it is merely being realistic about who finds their way to this controversial article and a healthy cynicism about some readers intransigence one reader has left a very rude domineering comment on my user page if personal attacks like that are the norm i can only assume that a number of fellows are paid to patrol this article and its objectivity should be flagged on the title page joe circus talk',0

mass deletions and synopsis at this point i think it is important to discuss what constitutes excessive detail when it comes to a multiissue crossover event given that the storyline covers months of details and multiple points of view each seperate series we should come to a consensus on what should be included in the article and what should be left to the imagination or primary sources there also seems to be an effort on the parts of some editors to delete material without consensus so this is an attempt to find that consensus please chime in on your views of the organization structure and content of the article',0

re reverts hello drmargi i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for saying what needed to be said to me but in a very respectful sophisticated manner i have taken the time to review both articles you referenced especially personal attacks while what i said was not directed at any specific person it was in direct conflict with a portion of what constitutes a personal attack for that i would like to apologize the reason i verbally came out swinging so to speak is because of misdirected frustration there is an individual with whom i had a conflict regarding the episode page of another show a show about which i am almost as passionate as i am about person of interest and that very same person if one of those who reverted my edit mind you for good reason i now know however when this took place on another tv show is page he was extremely passive aggressive and hostile in his immediate discrediting of my editing abilities i had just started using wikipedia at the time and was not very proficient in computational cyber protocol or even writing code that is not the case anymore please do not misinterpret this as i know i am the one in the wrong and i am not trying to engage in a dialogue in which i somehow look like the victim i just feel as though i needed to explain myself and who better with whom to do so than the one of users on wikipedia who have shown me respect and made me feel welcome i am well aware that the world will not end if the poi season info is not complete lol if i thought the world were to end i would not be on my computer but passive aggression aside i sincerely am a person who loves person of interest and criminal minds as they have helped me deal with deepseeded problems in my own life as farfetched as that may sound so i make it my business to do the best i can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible and wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so in my mind i saw how many little error notices wikipedia has put on the poi episode lists and wondered why my mistake was immediately centered out but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary over times was not reprimanded however it is foolish to assume they were not i reacted much in disproportion to the situation and i do not intend to do so again as i want to respect wikipedia is rules i just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me that did in fact happen on a page for criminal minds and i was the aggrieved party in that case my information was solid came straight from a coexecutive producer and yet this person continued reverting it so i sought help and reported him however to think that same scenario applies to this poi conflict i now see how slanted and nonsensical that is in conclusion i will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source credible and solid like my addition of fred toye as director and andy callahan as cowriter of poi episode the th i do apologize if i have offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration thank you for informing me of where i went wrong and remaining respectful and composed i love to learn and i am glad i have learned more specific information about how to avoid referenceedit infoconflicts i also want you to know that i am well aware that wikipedia is not a fan site while i intend to show you the utmost respect that was uncalled for i can read very well in fact je peux parler en fran\xc3\xa7ais aussi et je peux le comprendre i know that wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is why i try to be as thorough as possible and if this sentence comes off as condescending that is because you offended me as well i did not insult you or anyone specifically what i did was make a childish angerdriven juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty or selfappointed leaders it was a mistake to do so and since i am not very good at conflict resolution the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that i am going to stop now because i am starting to argue with my own intentions please forgive my outburst and be assured that it will not happen again i will continue to help build a stronger season episode table with solid references but i fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself thank you for helping me to stay informed so that i can continue to inform fellow tv crime drama fans happy editing and thank you for your kindness and composure in this matter b edward bef',0
another worthy editor with whom i disagree about his recent editing of what i first wrote six months ago actually gives the best evidence that clarification of the word uphold is appropriate if not in fact needed in this article as you can read above he states on this discussion page that no clarification of the word \xe2\x80\x9cuphold\xe2\x80\x9d is needed because it is such a simple word he says \xe2\x80\x9cif people are smart enough to access wikipedia they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word i am willing to concede all of your other points but i will continue to revert your changes if you insist on adding the word approved twice no less to clarify the elementary word uphold emphasis added yet even this intelligent and wellexpressed editor was confused as to the meaning when he first edited by removing \xe2\x80\x9capproved\xe2\x80\x9d as a clarification of the word \xe2\x80\x9cupheld\xe2\x80\x9d he did so not because it was a commonly understood word that was incapable of being misunderstood as he now says it is no his reason was the complete opposite he changed it because at that time he misunderstood the meaning of the word in his own explanation of the edit on the revision history page for this article he wrote his reason for removing the word \xe2\x80\x9capproved\xe2\x80\x9d stating on december the following \xe2\x80\x9c december upholding is different from approving emphasis added\xe2\x80\x9d he changed it because he thought the words had different meanings he understands now but has briefly no doubt as can we all forgotten that people as did he can misunderstand these terms he is also correct that i did put that clarification twice i did so because it seemed appropriate when i sought to present the information in a suitably short yet accurate fashion however it is rather obvious that even twice isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough clarification for every time that every reader reads something this is true for us all even editors who take of their own time in an effort to improve wikipedia articles the other editor says \xe2\x80\x9cif people are smart enough to access wikipedia they should be smart enough to understand the meaning of an incredibly common word\xe2\x80\x9d i disagree respectfully even intelligent editors can and this instance did misunderstand what they thought was an incredibly common and elementary word such as \xe2\x80\x9cupheld\xe2\x80\x9d please understand that this is not a personal attack in any way and that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and thoughtful efforts at editing are valuable it\xe2\x80\x99s just that the circumstances are that the very person who now says that the clarification is so completely inappropriate here that he will continue to remove such clarification every time in the future that it is restored is the same person who originally took out the explanation not because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t needed but rather because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t himself understand what the term meant we are all human we are all learning the other editor is hardly alone in being human the reason that i could quickly find so many examples of clarification of the same term coincidently done in the same manner is that the term upheld is worth using it has a precise meaning especially to those in the legal field but it i',0

while agreeing broadly with the claim that the paragraph is unnecessary if it stays it should not include adraeus unsubstantiated claims about what strong atheists say about weak atheists aside from reverting to the earlier version i have tried to bring some consistency to the article in terms for example of how books are referred to and i have removed the final paragraph aside from being almost impenetrably ungrammatical it made reference to other disciplines as though atheism is itself a discipline and in general did not seem to be doing anything useful \xce\xbc\xce\xb5\xce\xbb \xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xcf\x84\xce\xb7\xcf\x82 mar utc',0
daniel vincent kelley is theory regarding this phrase first i want to point out that while it is claimed in the article that marie antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants nothing is cited to prove such the one antoinette quote that is offered to this end smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her own cause by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her there is nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the french people but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids so this statement that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her certainly does not certify marie antoinette as kind hearted or noble i suspect that much as the phrase is thrown around today it was probably thrown around by the clique of it is originator they probably had a real laugh suggesting things the peasants could eat when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy here is how i imagine the phrase came to be said by marie antoinette is she heard her royal family her mom and dad and step parents maybe her grandparents talking about what had been said in an age past when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause then when she found herself in the situation she used what was in her circle a cliche that was widely unknown to the rest of the world she probably did not think much of saying it she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around never become more widely known that she said it and probably she had not really considered how callous it is when people are starving to make light of it so my guess is that exactly as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured peasants starving marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se originated it the phrase circulated amongst royalty for years probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se how callous and witty and devilishly fun from the sadistic royal perspective so marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se originates it marie antoinette is family speaks of it tells the story marie antoinette happens upon the same situation bread shortage she rehashes the phrase originated by marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se rouseau writing of it attributing it to a princess who he had not heard first hand say it proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles he says some earlier royal said it presumably she said it to other royals and presumably rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals so obviously if marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se said it years before rouseau wrote it obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hijinks those callous witty royals do for love of reliving the old times and as lessons to the young royals on how to live marie antoinette saying it in royal company would be like her saying i am on your side royal friends it is basically a slightly witty way for marie antoinette to say she does not care how the peasants get through their hard times how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times callous is her intent and plan it was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation many here have claimed that because rouseau wrote it before antoinette could possibly have said it means that antoinette never said it that is obviously nonsense she obviously did not originate the phrase credit marieth\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se but that would not prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit',0

almonds from dsduani wlu i am new at this and wonder if this is the right place to respond to your edits let me know if this is not the case in your recent edit on almonds you stated that almond is often substituted for vanilla by diabetics both almond and vanilla extract have about the same amount of sugar and calories so i am not sure if this is useful information diabetics may substitute one for the other but i do not think it has any effect on their diabetes or diabetic diet i am replying on your talk page my smile for the week i just wanted say thank you for the barnshine i keep meaning to say so but everytime i log in i see something that irks me and then off i go i am kind of a flake like that i noticed your arbcom deal good luck with that i hope a happy solution could be found for all parties involved even if you and i are often on the same page when it comes to all of that cheers emboldening moved from user page just thought i would give you a chill by answering over here regarding the use of bolditalics i can not quote you the official rule but in the real world titles for long works are either italicized or underlined and as far as i have seen on wikipedia the same holds true here bold is only used for the subject of the article in the first sentence and generally for emphasis oops sorry about the user page thing total brainfart images need removed please remove these images from your user page as they are in violation with wpfairpolicy number since no fair use images can be used on user pages thanks imagered magegif imageff usa boxartjpg imagefinal fantasy i battlepng imagestanpng imageericpng squeaky here hi thanks for the note you left me regarding my article on bridget taylor a few points if i may i am new to this so i am not really good at i do not think you hate me and i see how much obviously better the article is with your edits so i am actually grateful you are really good at this i am not but i would like to learn so seeing the changes that you made to my original i can not help but agree they improved the article every one of them so no complaints hereyou have my thanks just to clear up a couple of kind of misconceptions i really had no agenda i do not know bridget taylor i was not promoting her in the sense of i think she needs to be promoted if i was promoting her it is more because i have become a huge user of wikipedia myself it is become the first place i go to research any subject person place or thing given that i totally respect the fact you are such a great editor as a user of the information provided here i also hope that the subject matter is comprehensive fact filled current and factual so again i am not offended by the need for editing rather i welcome it getting back to my agenda i became aware of bridget taylor through a child with autism and did some research on her background i found that she is widely considered to be the leading expert practicing the use of aba therapy and that she is truly a tireless advocate for autistic children and adults my sole agenda honestly was not to promote her but to have her listed in wikipedia when the parents of child get the dreaded diagnosis of autism they tend to search for everything and anything in their power to help their child i have learned in my research that taylor s work and practice are of the utmost importance especially to the parents of very young children first diagnosed the alpine learning group is arguably but not many would argue the point the best placement for an autistic child in the country so given what i had learned from my research i just thought it was very important to growing segment of the population that taylor just be listed in wikipedia honestly i am without agenda in fact i am not a fan of aba therapy it is however the only scientific method proven to help autisic children learn which is a valuable thing a parent can use dietary supplements adjunct therapies etc which i totally support in the meantime while waiting to see the results there is a small window of opportunity when a child is brain is still pliable and they are at their peak learning age that window goes from maybe years old so to me it seems very important to use what we have available aba therapy so that child all autistic children make the strides they are able to make in lear',0

perhaps the addition of a discussion of jerry pournelle is iron law of bureaucracy will provide sufficient amplification of the typical american attitude toward this institution to account for the negative connotation almost universally accorded the concept of bureaucracy in american culture in which the bureaucratic imperative \xe2\x80\x94 however it manifests \xe2\x80\x94 is utterly despised indeed pournelle is relatively dispassionate criticism of bureaucracy may not go far enough to accurately convey the pure hatred held by the average american for bureaucrats and everything having to do with the institution of bureaucracy in both the private and the public sectors it does not for example address the bureacrat is propensity for sloughing responsibility there is a reason bureaucrats are seen as asscoverers whose foremost priority is to ensure that they are never accountable for anything it is because many bureaucrats really are asscoverers whose overriding priority is to ensure that they are never accountable for anything as a corollary if things go wrong support for the idea that you predicted it may be helpful in building your bureaucracy is importance at the expense of its rivals this is as true within corporations as it is in the public sector or the military if you have spent much time in the working world you have seen this tendency in action which is in american eyes particularly despicable for its abject cowardice as well as its wastefulness ineffectiveness and inherently obstructionist effects hm and while we are at it how come we are not discussing the sheer vogosity of bureaucracy this attitude toward the bureaucrats does not really seem to be an exclusively american peculiarity at all does it',0

if the kla had a tactical victory they would have completed their strategic goal if they had a decisive victory they would have killed almost all the yugoslav army troops but the truth is they have killed around or or yugoslav troops just like the nato bombing of yugoslavia the nato said they destroyed about or armored assault vehicles but the truth is that they destroyed only or less vehicles the yugoslav had volunteers from russia greece and i believe yugoslav volunteers nato was involved but had about six aircraft b f and ac i believe the aircraft in the parenthesis are the ones that were used but did not inflict casualties but for the f i believe inflicted casualties so yugoslavia had less casualties than the kla because regular troops are stronger than militias or guerrillas because they have better handling and training on weapons and hand to hand combat and have armored weapons and tanks and many more the kla only had guns',0

nonauthority professor samuel eliot morison to some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery how could a foreign chartmaker note suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same lanerio de janua wool weaver of genoa presented in the raccolta document xxxxi from morison going against the documents promoted the woolweaver to a chartmaker of low birth who had been literally \xe2\x80\x9con the beach\xe2\x80\x9d a few years before marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom already about years old when she caught young christopher\xe2\x80\x99s roving eye her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay and as soninlaw to secure an upandcoming young man of gentlemanly manners who asked for no dowry samuel eliot morison admiral of the ocean sea little brown boston this previous extract is a fantasy invented by morison and a big lie this is a fabrication by morison written completely without any proof morison did not find anything related to filipa is dowry and the truth is that filipa\xe2\x80\x99s mother was not paying any \xe2\x80\x9cconvent bills\xe2\x80\x9d because filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the monastery of santos belonging to the elite military order of santiago where she had all expenses paid as a comendadora just like her cousin ana de mendon\xc3\xa7a king john ii is mistress and her aunt violante nogueira nanny of king john ii is aunts and even participated in the management of the allsaints comendary morison even invented that his \xe2\x80\x9ccolombo peasant\xe2\x80\x9d was an upandcoming star a prodigy as if the motherinlaw isabel moniz already knew in only years after supposedly washing ashore penniless and not able to speak portuguese or even italian that the woolweaver was going to be a famous star in furthermore filipa is marriage in had to be authorized by king john ii who was master of the comendadoras of santiago contrary to what morison and his supporters of the woolweaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage it was impossible for filipa moniz to have married a nonnoble twobit weaver the likes of that genoese colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money no education no ship nor even a job in that closed highclass society of portugal\xe2\x80\x94a noble society so restricted that the captain of madeira actually arrested his brother is noble widow for marrying a nobleman below her station there is no doubt that filipa\xe2\x80\x99s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any woolweaver the whole tale invented by morison of a peasant marrying a noble portuguese captain\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of admiral crist\xc3\xb3bal col\xc3\xb3n the motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the myth of the genoese weaver and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer don fernando col\xc3\xb3n who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were falsely calling him a craftsman as such the admiral would not have learned so many letters or sciences especially the four main sciences astrology cosmography geometry and navigation the admiral was a man of letters and of great experience and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts today is investigations and scientific research confirms that don fernando col\xc3\xb3n was right and that his father could never have been the woolweaver colombo or pigeon but was instead a k\xc3\xb5lon or member of some special noble family \xc2\xabd maria de noronha foi castigada de forma violenta e cruel pelo cunhado martim gon\xc3\xa7alves da c\xc3\xa2mara a encarcerou numa pris\xc3\xa3o da torre de bel\xc3\xa9m como a exp\xc3\xb4s \xc3\xa0 vergonha de atravessar as ruas de lisboa entre esbirros sobre uma mula com as m\xc3\xa3os manietadas\xc2\xbb doutor gaspar frutuoso saudades da terra edi\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o do instituto cultural de ponta delgada p\xc3\xa1gina historie del sd fernando colombo nelle quali sha particolare vera relatione della vita de fatti dellammiraglio d christoforo colombo suo padre et dello scoprimento cheegli fece dellindie occidentali dette mondo nuovo hora possedute dal sereniss re catolico nuouamente di lingua spagnuola tradotte nellitaliana dal s alfonso ulloa published in appresso francesco de franceschi sanese in venezia manuel rosa in columbus the untold story it is amazing that after all the research that has been published in portugal and spain in the lat year including the admiral is original coat of arms that we still insist on propping up the old fairy tale of t',0

hai subject to determine the best way to test for a feature refer to the documentation for the feature of interest the following list discusses some common techniques for feature detection you can test for the presence of the functions associated with a feature to test for the presence of a function in a system dll call the loadlibrary function to load the dll then call the getprocaddress function to determine whether the function of interest is present in the dll use the pointer returned by getprocaddress to call the function note that even if the function is present it may be a stub that just returns an error code such as errorcallnotimplemented you can determine the presence of some features by using the getsystemmetrics function for example you can detect multiple display monitors by calling getsystemmetricssmcmonitors there are several versions of the redistributable dlls that implement shell and common control features for information about determining which versions are present on the system your application is running on see the topic shell and common controls versions if you must require a particular operating system be sure to use it as a minimum supported version rather than design the test for the one operating system this way your detection code will continue to work on future versions of windows',0

interesting discussions here although we all have to admin that their is lack of sources most of the sources we have are nonenglish if anybody want indian i sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be pathans because they were major player in history of india i think most of their era was spend in india i remember karturaghti is mentioning that ghurids were not farsi and that their offspring hated farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts with all respect to iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that pashtuns or afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their so called true and first pashtun dynasty many of our sources point out that pathans were the owners of ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim invaders also talk the iranica is is too vague if \xc5\xa1ansab\xc4\x81n\xc4\xab family were persian sassanianmiddle persian and it comes the word from the name wi\xc5\xa1nasp and who was wi\xc5\xa1nasp what or who was wi\xc5\xa1nasp iranians and indians always exchange names such as iraj should we claim iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived raj wi\xc5\xa1nasp does help in anything only one guy justi namenbuch in mentions about wi\xc5\xa1nasp with less than word and not even details so we believe in that just because iranica says so i personally do not see any logical trace between i remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when arabs came we were not aware of arabs or islam our forefathers accepted islam and blessed by khlifa ali the shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the arabs like the parsis of india one sure thing i know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of afghanistan and considered themselves antipersian because the fella called farsiwan seems to pull out something which i researched correct me if i am wrong why did suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of persia and helped spread islam why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids who were panabbasids the most important concept here is that ghurid were afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts because of their nature being natives of khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern persian language so what is the problem',0

thanks heah this is helpful something to consider is that the references you pointed to \xe2\x80\x93 which are part of a larger list are very old and are based on work done in the early years of aids also that subsequent research has not supported the same results the primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to aids or more specifically to kaposi\xe2\x80\x99s sarcaoma is that they are very weak in terms of data presented the results have not been repeated by other scientists in fact within the list of referenced studies there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers the general consensus in the research community and in the hivaids community is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to hivaids may look impressive to the untrained eye they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes hiv infection or kaposi\xe2\x80\x99s sarcaoma ks',0

november utc well guy i was going to ask you why if i have been blocked what your interest was in it and why there was no notice to that effect by the blocking administrator here on my talk page but then when i come to post that i happen to glance at the jumble of a signature there and see that the guy who was posting on my talk page was the same as the jzg who appears in my block log so then the question becomes why the thirdperson passivevoice nonsense what is this right now you have a block of days stuff as if you are informing me of someone else is actions you blocked me just say soespecially if you are going to twiddle with your user name so that what i see in the notice is something different from what i see in my block log i almost mistook you for some wellintentioned soul who thought that he was going to offer to help out in some unspecified way in my reeducation some helpful innocent bystander with a help button in his signature for some reason or anther to say that one cannot raise an issue and claim on a forum for making such complaints about the actions of editors such as wpani that an editor is actions have been rude and inconsiderate or even aggressive your word if i had said that is ludicrous it is totally contrary to all sense of fairness and due process on wikipedia or anywhere else raising such an issue is clearly not a violation of wpcivil whether or not in your subjective opinion you can find some excuse for that actionbut you have not even bothered to try to do that but you also seem to have entirely missed the point of the issue i raised at wpani rlevse is actions in disrupting the process are not wrong becasue he was incidentally rude and inconsiderate to me in doing so they are wrong because they are bad for wikipedia they are wrong because they corrupt the process of the various dispute resolution network we have they would have been wrong if he had been pleasant and nice to me and had tried to discuss things with me and actually accomplish something rather than blocking me out of the blue the fact that he was rude and inconsiderate is irrelevant to that issue i even pointed that out there and do not understand how you could have missed that you are instead assuming bad faith on my part in addition to not paying any attention to the actual issues raised there you have turned a blind eye to the issue that was raised just because for whatever reasonand i do not have a clue what it isyou have taken a dislike to me not a good foundation for any discussion but then you are not really interested in discussion are you no more so than rlevse no in fact much less sohe did not block me to keep me from responding to anything he had said he merely did not say anything anywhere you otoh have blocked me specifically to stop me from addressing your response or anyone else is on the wpani discussion and the subsequent one on wpan the disruption of wqa was done to give an advantage in content disputes to usergreg l who had already had a wikipediawikiquette alerts on his own actions at kilogram filed by userenuja in this back on september before i ever got involved in that discussion there the issues raised then have continued almost unabated or even in a worsening manner with a changing cast of characters other than the constant greg l involvement and remain largely unresolved',0

actually the article you are referring tothe quest for the historical jesus is about the quest for the historical jesus is the academic effort to use historical methods to provide a historical portrait of jesus and this article is about those historical portriats of jesus that is why it should be renamed historical portraits of jesus and you both seem to be confused about the difference between historicity and historical portraits john you seem to think that biblical scripture is accepted as being historically accurate and akhilleus you seem to think that the historical methods used to provide a historical portrait of jesus are different than the historical methods used by muslim scholars to provide a historical portrait of jesus both of your positions are christian pov neutral pov here would be a secular one and from that perspective islamic portraits by muslim scholars can be included that is unless the name of the article is changed to christian historical portraits of jesus perhaps this article should be merged with the quest for the historical jesus article',0

to state that is not correct is contradicting sourced material from the context it appears that youre trying to contradict me but i do not see how your comment advances that goal that the resolution did not explicitly assert either claim absolutely is sourced one need only look at the resolution to see that that critics have not found a claim which is clearly false is a negative claim do you seriously expect me to prove it what else is there that critics have claimed the war is based on lies you are not seriously disputing that are you so what exactly are you claiming is unsourced and incorrect nice how anything that does not fit with your radical leftism is a highly biased slant as i have said the resolution never claimed that there was a working relationship between sh and aq if you want to claim that the resolution implied false statements fine but anyone who claims that there is a single statement in the resolution which is an outright lie is simply being dishonest now the resolution cites iraq is alleged weapons of mass destruction capability it does not cite iraq is alleged weapons of mass destruction therefore your edit is inaccurate and unsourced since you have been informed of the error and yet you continue to make a claim that you know is false your editing is clearly vandalism and if you continue to remove the word capability i will seek administrative action there is simply no room for disagreement on the contents section when discussing what a document says we should quote what it actually says rather than editing it for political convenience in the weapons of mass destruction and alqaeda section you again are restoring unsourced statements the cite for the claim that wmd and aq were the main reasons is simply an article saying that there were rationales it does not actually say what any of those rationales are let alone make any determinations as to which arguments were principal it is quite the pot calling the kettle black when you insist on including completely unsourced claims yet refuse to allow me to present any opposing views on the basis that it is highly biased',0

maybe the particular edit you pointed out was harmless but it could be a warning of harmful edits that have already or will in the future happen if the logic that the bot is following is to take a page range from a database and overwrite a page or range provided to an editor then sooner or later it will make harmful edits so the logic should be simple if the page or pages parameter is present and nonempty the bot should not edit it',0

the official name is official from one party is point of view still its accepted as the title of the article and given importance all over the article but as the same term is not accepted by entire world for that territory so both terms should be mentioned in the infobox and also as the term redirects on this page its worth mentioning it there encyclopedia should contain all kind of possible information about any topic as per jammu kashmir please go ahead and write it disputed as that is also disputed between parties with same logic as here but currently as we are talking about azad kashmir so we should focus on this article only thanks shekhar',0

well first i reject the whole suitable for a general encyclopedia argument because it is just not relevant wikipedia is more than that because it is not subject to the constraints that have bound traditional encyclopedias size is irrelevant i have got a half terabyte external usb drive on the linux server across the room that is smaller and lighter than a paperback well cryptonomicon at least assuming good bitonal tiff document images that will hold million scanned pages assuming moderately compact text files palmos reader format that jumps to million pages printing costs are also irrelevant since it is not printed as are writing costs monetary and temporal as the labor force is both free and unbounded in size so it is back to first principles the definition of encyclopedia is a book or set of books containing articles on various topics usually in alphabetical arrangement covering all branches of knowledge or less commonly all aspects of one subject dictionarycom unabridged v since wikipedia is unbound by the constraints of other encyclopeidas then i truly believe that it should cover all branches of knowledge and cover them far more thoroughly than has heretofore been possible as far as sysadmin topics go wikipedia failed me this week if the article on domain name system had even so much as a link to resolvconf i could have save myself a lot of digging when i set up that linux system in fact i will probably do just that along with showing the file format of resolvconf to that article now that i have figured it out why because it is useful information that i needed and failed to find when i looked for it it is not quite narrating the process but it certainly is within the scope of an article on the dns process to describe the steps taken by each part and one of those steps would be the client checks the list of dns servers see resolvconf etc to determine which name server to consult that is all i would have needed to find the information i needed to solve my problem as jimmy wales said our goalis to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet empowering people everywhere to have the information they need to make good decisions that is my guiding principle when i work on wikipedia and i feel that the accurizing article fits that perfectly',0

you are conflating issues here this is not an assumption of bad faith it is adhering to what the source actually says william m connolley is extemporaneous comments here are not a source the publication realclimate is the source this is just a frank evaluation of what the source says realclimate says nothing about who worked on the article or how it was written but we know that unsigned group pieces are often not equivalent to joint authorship for another analogy consider per curium legal opinions per curium means that all of the judges or justices agreed but it is a very different thing from all of them signing the opinion typically they are less controversial cases so one judge is clerk writes the opinion then they are circulated for comment but the other judges typically do not scrutinize it as closely as if their name was on the line there are many examples of judges railing against dicta that they theoretically endorsed just a couple of years earlier\xe2\x80\x94sometimes even within the same case unanimous opinions where every judge signs are different and they reflect a higher level of collaboration as in brown v board of education the bottom line is that the source itself does not say who wrote it the commentators on blpn seem to think this is an important distinction luke',0

car is objection and nebilla is reply about the legal aspects of turkey is action answer to i your arguments are very biased and unethical you took sentences that suit you from different documents to make a point without revealing the conclusiontrue intentions of the author in your sources answer i directly wrote what is written in the resolutions and books the title of the heading the legal aspects of turkey is action cannot prevent you put the resolutionssources that indicate the operation as illegal ii why did not you write the whole thing ans in the book it wrote the member states did not maintain this view after the second round of military operations is not something that is related with pace the views of the member states of a particular organization here pace does not bind the organization itself unless there is a resolution is made in that organization iii the resolution of the un security council and general assembly indicate that the turkish invasion was an illegal act in contrast with your other argument that there is no un resolution that calls the turkey is action as invasion ans here in this sentence indicate that the turkish invasion was an illegal act is a naming that is done by the author not the un security council what is binding in un is the un sc as you may know and once again i am backing my writing there is no un resolution that calls the turkey is action as invasion if you claim otherwise just put a resolution nodate so that we are all behind you at this point here is the whole un sc resolutions un resolutions which one of them calls the intervention as invasion no one iv kareklas concludes nevertheless having regard to the equally powerful arguements militating against unilateral armed intervention envisaged by treaty it may be clearly concluded that turkey should not have exercised a right of intervention in cyprus however such a proposition could remain subject to criticism in view of the peculiarities of the cyprus issue ans even the greek kareklas uses the word intervention as you see dear should not have exercised a right of intervention even demonstrates the legality of the intervention the fact i empasized about the legality of operation in that aspect should not have exercised a right of intervention means that there is a right of intervention but it would be nice if that right was not used and the issue was solved by other means if you do not understand in this way you should develop your english v in just after years later the operation the greece is athens court of appeals the turkish military intervention in cypruswas legal here greece is court did not distinguish between the st phase july and nd phase august of the operation in both of the first and second operation already finished years ago greece is court hence thought legal situation of both of the operations in advance of making any decision about the war in the sentence the turkish military intervention in cypruswas legal do you find any separation about both phase of the operations vi so dear as you see i did not take the specific parts of the sources in part the title the legal aspects of turkey is action does not prevent you to find and write illegal aspects of the operation as well you are welcome to state this as long as these are not the parts of the interested parties you can be sure that the sources you will find will be welcome as you see i directly write the text of pace is resolution pace is not one of the two parties i directly write the text of the decision of the greece is court here greece is court certainly is a party but indicates opiniondecision just opposite to greece is government that is you should show sources i not a party neutral source ii one of the parties but express opposite view to the party in which it is located itself',0

actually my goal is to make a neutral pov present in these articles which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users you have both consistently made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous pov edits i am not denying the link between iberia and the british isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions the relationship is only based on the ychromosome and mtdna inheritance shared with all western european regions it needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r b ychromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both ychromosomes and mtdna there is very little to no evidence of autosomal and xchromosome analysis and when viewing the ychrommtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole r b is found across western europe in high frequencies but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other there is no genetic evidence yet of a neolithic link between the british isles and iberia since r b traces back to a paleolithic iberian refuge the neolithic and following periods were quite different between the iberian and the british isles and the neolithic ychrom and mtdna percentage is much larger in iberia than in britain or ireland you also must not rely so significantly on references by sykes or oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles i have read through both books and they really do make hasty unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to there are also books already out and also some to be released in the following months which contradict and refute many of the findings or conclusions of oppenheimer and sykes their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of dna need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings i do agree that i should discuss my edits when i make them and i will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article',0

mlk incident it is true that greenberg said what he said it is true that a chicago sun times blog reported what he said those two facts in and of themselves do not make the mlk incident relevant to his espn career the fact that there was no meaningful followup coverage in reliable sources should establish that alleging that greenberg is comment was a freudian slip simply because he has mentioned making such slips requires a citation from a reputable source establishing that he said he makes freudian slips i will assume good faith on the part of the ip editor who has been reinserting the mlk incident but i strongly question the relevance of including what appears to be a simple spoonerism even if it has racial connotations',0

not my business to go and unearth the original source documents if you read widely enough instead of relying on large overview sources and have more than a superficial interest in the subject sooner or later you might unearth the original documents which are surprisingly easy to come by a large portion of the naval history books i have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing and if you are lucky you will find books which quote documents verbatim last weekend i had the great pleasure to take advantage of a incompetent error made by the national archives and was able to download a few dozen service records for free instead of the hundreds of pounds of the five hundred poundsthousand dollars plus i would normally have had to pay already i have seen where certain historians gordon in the rules of the game is one have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of admiralty literature it is bad enough that in many cases he does not cite specifically the details of the correspondence involved but it really did not help that the naval historical section literally purged untold numbers of documents a process which was finally halted in the late fifties therefore quite literally a lot of marder is scholarship depends on his reputation and not the facts talk',0

edit disagreements where are you getting the figure range for from i could not find these figures in any of the sources you cited unless you are estimating based on predictions from the article abu omar alshishani is not the chief in command of both iraq and syria this is ridiculous i do not know why so many people believe this i suspect it might be becuase he is so prevalent in the is propaganda that he is somehow the islamic state is version of napoleon bonaparte i cannot find any reputable source claiming he is anything more than a field commander in northern syria he does not even feature in any is leadership hierarchies which are almost exclusively staffed by iraqis who have been in the organisations since the earlymid is when the former commander of the is military council passed away in june abu abdulrahman albilawi iraqi secutyi forces found some memory sticks and a laptop containing the following leadership information currently pieced together by western analysts note how alshishani does not feature in any of them save one which turned out to be incorrect here they are here is the false one which showed alshishani succeeding albilawi as the is military chief of the military shura however it was abu ayman aliraqi another is iraqi commander who had been in the organisation years before alshishani had joined who succeeded albilawi as the chief of the military shura he is shown in the graph as adnan latif hamid alsweidawi which is his real name you never see the upper echelons of the is hierarchy the ones who actually control everything they are not shown in is propaganda they are clandestine mysterious shadowy figures only the pawns are revealed you keep stating that jamaatulahrar have pledged allegiance to the islamic state this is just not true you might get this impression becuase they broke away from the ttp or the pakistani taliban which swear allegiance to the head of the afghan taliban mullah omar but the spokesperson for jamaatulahrar stated that they pledged allegiance to the taliban leader the leader of jamaatulahrar omar khalid has strong ties to ayman alzawahiri and alqaeda a nemesis to the islamic state you state that abu sayyaf have sworn allegiance to the islamic state however the man who swore allegiance to them is not the groups leader so it is unclear whether or not he is representing abu sayyaf or a splinter faction you write that ansar alislam is an alqaeda affiliate but i can find little to no proof affirming this position the leadership of ansar alislam have rejected the notion that they swear allegiance to alqaeda despite collaborating with their affiliates such as the alnusra frontus terrorism expert rohan gunaratna in january however disagreed with krekar and affirmed links of ansar with alqaeda \xe2\x80\x9cansar alislam has links with alqaeda \xe2\x80\x93 in fact it is an associate group of alqaeda\xe2\x80\x9d the us defense intelligence agency seemed to have affirmed this when they wrote ansar alislam is an independent organization that receives assistance from alqaeda but is not a branch of the groupdia special analysis july cited in postwar findings about iraq is wmd programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments pg',0

allstarecho is correct in what he says there is no reference to malemale sexual relationships in the section personal relationships here is what it currently says in it is entirety james is personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to anne of denmark with whom he fathered his children growing up james did not have any parents for his father henry stuart lord darnley was murdered and his mother mary i of scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer james hepburn th earl of bothwell his grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood and he had no siblings someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about james is sexuality the word relationships could mean anything depending i also agree with carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from jacobean england is as are concepts of male bonding friendship and what is acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods however there are reliable sources that say james had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates call it what you will but excising that from the main article section is not fair do not use modern terms if that is the issue also the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article and several of them are approx to words long footnote is words i would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it including the assertion that it is murky and debated even if that section is shorter as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about james is sexuality then work on the daughter article per the suggestion that seems fair and balanced something that i wish to work toward but to excise mention of anything other than platonicfamily relations from the main article is not sorry but footnotes do not count people just do not generally read them \xe2\x80\x94',0
wikipedia iswas a fantastic resource that is now experiencing an exodus of wonderful contributors for a plethora of reasons and is having it is content distributed across the web for profit due to ridiculous policies what made this project great was people challenging the norm and saying hey this is how things are done but lets try it this way what is killing this project is goodmeaning yet damaging editors following the rules and saying hey this is how things are done i am not a great editor not even a very good one i sort of stumbled my way through wp leaving a trail of destruction and fuckups as i went but i always generally meant well and being reprimanded for reverting an obvious vandal epitomises what is wrong with wp now i used to edit pretty heavily especially vandalfighting but for the past six months or so have not seen the point because although the vandals are damaging the policies and regular editors are downright lethal hj mitchel was in my honest opinion a cunt to do what he did people can make up their own mind exactly what that was i am not saying he is a cunt of a person but as a wp editorcontributoradmin possibly through no fault of his own but by the fault of the rules policies and guidelines that he follows i do not want people berating me for what i have just typed or congratulating me i have spent enough time on wp to know that people will be willing to do both admittedly moreso in a more public forum and even more will simply think their opinions the response to this rant will be so wpstandard i sha not even bother checking talk to me',0
deindent sorry for kibitzing but i wanted to be fair to all points of view even those of the dualists so i tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions the thought experiment is this you have one observer the observer gets cloned into copy and copy either hubertyorick or startrek style the copies diverge either because of internal noise or because of the environment from a third person point of view this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on one observer becomes two if probed each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event but viewed from the inside if you are the observer getting cloned there is a very natural question you can ask am i going to end up being copy or am i going to be copy this question cannot even be formulated from the outside so it has no objective answer but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer this scenario is dennett is and to some extent everett is since the question does not even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms you might conclude that this question does not make any sense but in any case the answer to this question is bit of subjective information which both copy and copy know and which the original observer does not in the objective third person view there is no information gained you know that copy will say i am copy and copy will say i am copy to give an example of actual or and synth i will go beyond dennett is example suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely so that the cloning keeps happening again and again then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer from the first person perspective for example take a startrek duplicator and duplicate the observer and then duplicate each duplicate but add a twist the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way and then it does so again forty years later then sixty years later what is the subjective experience from a naive counting perspective i should predict that i would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies on the other hand the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates so perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state even worse how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator boltzmann is brain is a similar idea',0

as i promised here is a brief discussion of the different types of distillation used in the hydrocarbon processing industries that i am very familiar with ie oil refineries petrochemical plants natural gas processing plants extracting natural gas liquids known as ngl is and other hydrocarbon processing industries those industries probably have perhaps or more of the industrial distillation columns in existence other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry the alcohol distilling industry and the fine chemicals industry also use quite a bit of distillation but i am not familiar with those industries major industrial distillation types the two primary types of industrial distillations are continuous fractionation or continuous distillation and batch distillation the industrial continuous fractionation distillation towers are typified by the large vertical cylindrical columns as can be seen in the oil refinery photograph in the fractional distillation article please note that by continuous i mean hours a day for to years before being temporarily shut down for maintenance and we are talking about towers with diameters ranging from about centimeters to meters and heights ranging from about meters to meters or more there are many subsets of the continuous fractionation primary distillation type such as fractional distillation vacuum distillation azeotropic distillation extractive distillation steam distillation the above subsets would be of approximately the same size range is the primary continuous fractionation towers the vacuum towers require reinforcement provided by a number of steel beams encircling the tower exteriors so that they can withstand the difference in pressure between the exterior atmospheric pressure and the interior vacuum as for the vaporliquid contacting trays or plates used in industrial distillation towers it is virtually impossible to explain bubblecap or valve trays or sheet steel structural packing without drawings or photographs we need someone who could make such drawings we also need someone who can make a drawing of a typical kettletype reboiler commonly used as the heat input to a distillation tower although there are other types of reboilers such as fired furnaces horizontal or vertical heat exchangers bayonet heat exchangers etc finally if you look at the the simple sketch that i made of a typical fractionation tower overhead system in the fractional distillation article that sketch needs to be made longer so that it shows the feedstream entry at about the center height of the tower and the bottoms exiting the tower and entering the kettle reboiler with the final liquid bottoms product leaving the kettle reboiler and the reboiled vapor returning from the kettle to the tower',0

wrong focus i am new here but it seems to me that this page as it now reads is about ihdcad to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease while it may be true that the term is usually used to refer to those diseases related to atherosclerosis arterial disease i would suggest that this is careless usage to which this page need not subscribe so how should the article be structured i would say look to the table of contents of a textbook of cv disease for a model with the change that i would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section with links in the relevant anatomic regions other headings might include congenital heart disease valvular heart disease cardiomyopathies dysrhythmias and conduction abnormalities diseases of the coronary arteries diseases of the pericardium diseases of the aorta and great vessels brachiocephalic and cerebrovascular disease other peripheral vascular disease arteritides systemic hypertension thrombosis and embolic disease other venous system disease diseases of the pulmonary vasculature and heart failure and transplantation some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy physiologydiagnosis and therapy would also be germane although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page i think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease',0

i know that the croatian perspective is somewhat different this comes from a very specific historiographical school which had among its roots grga novak assuming that dalmatia was one of the most primitive of europe at the time of venetian domination we must also think that since to the date you specified they are years josip smodlaka stated in that dalmatia was still one of the poorest regions of europe as you can understand we can not talk only of the italian evil foreign rule to explain this fact i think it is enough the logic to start to demand other questions which the historiography of your country has not yet met for your info marino bonda considered himself the italian podest\xc3\xa0 of ragusa and today is the last italian podest\xc3\xa0 of ragusa he never used or accepted the name bundic however if you want you can croatizate all the names i suggest antonio bajamonti antun bajamonti luigi lapenna alojz lapennic cosimo de begna possedaria kosimus benji posedarski lorenzo benevenia lovro benevenija antonio cippico antun cipiko roberto ghiglianovich robert giljanovic natale krekich nale krekic and so on those things are already made by your fellow countrymen in recent years',0

drug abuse before i attempt to do a major revision on this article i would like to get your opinion on the title i notice that substance abuse redirects to drug addiction so what is the current consensus for keeping drug abuse as a standalone article it seems to me that drug abuse should redirect to substance abuse and an attempt should be made to split substance abuse issues off of drug addiction what do you think if you disagree in what direction do you want to see the drug abuse article go and what topics do you think it should focus upon i was thinking it could examine the scientific poltical and social aspects viriditas i believe the drug abuse article existed to coincide with the drug use article which is a redirection to recreational drug use it could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted npov term and having appropriate redirects i agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article but then such an article substance abuse should also include information on alcohol abuse which currently has its own page as alcoholism the drug addiction page has some pov problems what should be done here is to leave drug addiction itself under the domain of addiction and rename the drug addiction page with all its references to brain chemistry and method of action to drug dependence anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page i am more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper npov naming even if they are stub articles as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages my vote would be to make substance abuse it is own page talking about substance abuse in general and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances ie alcoholism specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages i am certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages i am certain that some will be opposed to separating the good and the bad of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages consider alcohol alcoholic beverage alcoholism but if alcohol is treated that way then other substances deserve the same consideration if people disagree then i would argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined apr utc',0

what page no page was put up as an article per the wiki guidelines nothing was put up as an article a page was being utilized as a user page simply to figure out the structure of wikipedia to learn the coding of wikipedia and to experiment with some text was simply cut and pasted onto a page per wiki guidelines nothign was submitted as an article because the test area was to be kept to a user area this is what we were doing using the user name as a testing area per wiki guidlines no article would have been submitted until such time as it met wiki guidelines but you you deleted the page before that could take place are you really this obtuse in all seriousness testing are refining articles in user pages is encouraged by wikipedia this is what we were doing in our opinion you are not familiar enough with wiki guidelines to exercise any control over the deletion of articles it is the afternoon elementary school should be getting out soon there should be some year old that you can go outside and shove around i regret that you have little authority over your real life but i do not think the intent of wiki was for you to vent that frustration and lack of control in meatspace over the entirety of the encyclopedia thank is for deleting the demo template you complete and utter fuckwit next time we will just throw something into the public domain and give you something to actually do other than mentally masturbate',1

selected articles on portalf hello again i dropped notes round a while back to those who have listed themselves at wikipediawikiprojectformulaone to ask for suggestions for selected articles on portalformula one there was a pretty good response both in terms of how it might work and of articles suggested damon hill came out with the most support and was brought up to good article standard after a lot of work by skully collins before going on as the f portal selected article a couple of weeks ago it is now at featured article candidates as a featured article candidate why not drop by and see if you can help polish it further several people who responded to the original request suggested that a monthly or biweekly selected article could act as a catalyst for an improvement drive to get more articles up to a higher standard although it was not quite what i had in mind when i started this seemed to work pretty well for the damon hill article so i have drafted up a process for doing this more regularly see portaltalkformulaonemanagementofselectedarticles for details essentially the suggestion is that we vote for an article to improve every couple of weeks and at the end of the improvement process the article goes on the portal as the new selected article i would be grateful for any comments on how this might work i am sure some of you are more familiar with things wiki than me as well as your votes for the next candidate by july you may also want to help with the article gilles villeneuve which was the next most popular after damon hill the idea is to try and get it up to ga standard by july and then put it on the portal as the selected article i hope you can help',0

horse articles i agree that the use of footnotes or simply notes citations and references is perfectly acceptable however there is no consistency in the way these terms are used and on quite a few of the fa articles the term footnotes is used in place of citations or references and on at least two articles the notes were labelled notes and the citations were labelled footnotes there appears to be some misunderstanding as to when and where the terms notes andor footnotes ought to be used if citations is the preferred heading for inline references then you need to take this up with others who write about horses my point here is specifically to eliminate the wrong usage of the term footnotes for sections that do not contain anything that even vaguely resembles a footnote since consistency appeared to be an issue i changed a number of articles simply to make them consistent they have been changed back and unless someone has subsequently corrected them are no longer consistent',0
it was not my intent to editorialize the article on marcel lefebvre but i was trying to correct and add some information about him i did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a prolefebvre position as well i felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about lefebvre the two people who i called arch conservative were exactly that both men tried to derail the second vatican council and fought both john xxiii and paul vi and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way i do not know if thomas jefferson actually said this or not it was a quote the jefferson character made in the movie that he felt that king george iii was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the declaration of independance so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant and i have talked to catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals especially in the times before the second vatican council why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church it was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity i remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while he did not exactly what his grandfater is reasons were but he said it probably was not hard to guess why even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article that is why i added the tag because what i read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction jun utc',0

i think that one of the confounding issues is what to name what einstein called spooky action at a distance the idea of action involves the application of some force over some amount of time and our ordinary idea of causing something involves exerting force on some system to influence its behavior but entanglement is exhibited without the lag that would be required were interactions at a velocity \xe2\x89\xa4 c so something is going on that is not causal in the usual sense on the other hand before one or the other entangled twin particles is measured they both have the freedom or the potential to manifest either spin and after one of them is measured and must manifest a spin then the other no longer has the freedom or potential to manifest any spin other than the opposite of the one that was first measured so something has changed and it strikes me as creating an intellectual smokescreen to say that there is only some kind of abstract correlation involved like the collapse of a wavefunction we have no idea of what is going on or how to describe it all we know is that it happens it also strikes me as possibly significant that the time sequence may not be clear from my frame of reference electron a is observed first and electron b is observed second someone else in another frame of reference may see electron b as being observed first and electron a as being observed second there are also phenomena within the same frame of reference that we call retrocausal we have no way of knowing that the discovery of the polarity of photon b at time tn determines retrocausally the polarity of photon a at time t if we say that these changes are not local that must i think mean that they are not local in spacetime so in a sense i end up arguing against my own discomfort with the idea that there is only a correlation between the discovered states of any entangled twins if you are finding what i just wrote confusing imagine what the whole discussion will do to someone who has just heard an intriguing mention of quantum physics on tv and has come to wikipedia for more information we need to be very careful to make our vocabulary and explanations such that our article can be processed by such readers lack of appropriate words is a big challenge',0

andrew i was in two minds about including ad the only reason to include it was because people are unused to three digit years at least i am anyway i am happy to see it go i love simplicity just will not surrender it unless clarity is not thrown out with the bathwater as i said i am content explaining the nearest years rule is great also i was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter you have done this in a very neat and clear way thank you great to have you at work on things yes i thought about linking the books or not the main argument against was that it took so long to enter them however the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city for example to see manuscripts near their home say if they see that thessalonians is in a university library miles away maybe they will click on the link to thess to see what wiki editors have said about the book instead of looking for the first instance of thessalonians in the table or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at i agree about not overwikiing especially in the body of an article and especially if different words are given the same link tables by their nature are speedy reference systems i like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest one example of how i might use the table is to add a textual criticism section to articles on nt books that do not have one already i would sort the table by the contents field i know it is not perfect view the data relevant to a book and click through to it another use is to check just what corinthians chapters contain that article actually has links to specific chapters some of us know what is in chapters most will not though admittedly not all articles on nt books go to specifics on chapters but maybe in time they will now the work is done it seems like a pity to lose it rest assured i am not going to be writing articles with every second word wikified',0

i am sure many people would object to the images on the article anus or prefer to have a choice to wether or not view them yet there they are since wikipedia is not censored i also already drew comparisons to spoiler tags since the objection to the images seems to be that they are in a sence spoilers if you look both links you see that hiding the ink spot image is big deviation of the standard practise when far more controvesial material is shown plainly quite frankly i fail to see a reason for hiding the image that is not plain silly it is just an ink spot after all it is not rorschach images are hard to come by but the current image has the added value of authencity and should be shown openly as is wikipedia is purpose however it is not wikipedia is job to cater bend etc to demands aesthetics morals etc any particular group',0

hi wetman i think you have misunderstood the purpose of my edit i quite agree with what you have said i would never change the conventions of an article to suit my tastes and i never have in fact i am a british user who has on several occassions corrected rogue british spellings for the same reason if you look carefully there were two dates one was bc and the other was bce i can not be bothered looking up the relevant guidelines now but i believe they say wikipedia does not have any preference except that articles should be consistent i merely changed the first date that came to hand it seems to me that you may have inadvertently done what you accused me of my edit first established a bcbce convention and you went against that an anon not me has just changed the thing back to bc now but if you want to change it to bce again go ahead i am really not bothered but do change both dates this time however i think whoever reverted you last time would have good reason to complain if you reverted him all the best t \xe2\x80\xa2 c',0

you should familiarize yourself with the situation before blocking editors under wikipedia policy under the rr rule it states that leeway will be given to editors whose reverts undo vandalism andor help improve the article there is a solution to the edit warring that has been accepted by most editors that is to leave the rd paragraph of the lede as is until objectionssuggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it which is also according to wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution if you familiarize yourself with this from the talk page you will observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion without explanation without stating their objections first without submitting their proposed changes to peer review and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring i am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators i have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of if you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreedupon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes',0

equal treatment for transnistria we all agree that the transnistria page is a difficult one to edit because there are strong views on both sides the current page is a work of twisted words and opinions and is not acceptable to any fairminded person i have a proposal to normalise things here forgive me but it is a moldovan solution take a look at the moldova main space and you will see an interesting list of headings for the topics in keeping with the way most otherr states are dealt with then take a look at the headings for the transnistrian page and you will see a marked difference i suggest that the editors work under an agreement of equality and respect under this agreement headings are by dual agreement using moldova as a template for example the intro appears on both pages and should stay as should names geography history politics international relations economics human rights demograpghics economy information technology culture gallery external links headings that are parachuted onto the transnistrian page that are under dispute be removed this includes all the smuggling crime and travel warnings that is assuming the moldova page would prefer not to have such heading on that page under this each side is treated with equal rights attacks on the pages cease and a degree of harmony may prevail can i have your feedback please',0

things i have learned at enwikipedia when i made a change and i want that the edition appears i am a user disruptive because i do not respect the previous edition when i defend the previous edition the concept previous edition means nothing or the dates are ignored and i am the disruptive again the two solutions are good although it is not written anywhere exist a rule that says that any offense expires in a few days if you can not give notice of the offense because you were blocked ill or without computer for a mechanical failure bad luck for you here solutions not justice and that pope time erases the sins is a good solution open spaces for dialogue and discussion and pledge to respect the result is not a sign of wanting to do things right apparently appreciate the intention of a user is not feasible but ignore two serious violations of the rules is perfectly acceptable administrators tend to be more ruthless with solitary users than with organized groups if a user with a clean record discuss with another user with a nonclean record the administrator only monitor and punish the user with dirty record the other user will not have problems enjoy your toy friendly and honest gentlemen',0

british isles is to be avoided on wikipedia part of the ambiguity has probably arose from the fact that we are dealing with a geographical area great britain and ireland and a lot of the sources come from the met office and met eirann which almost exclusively publish information relevant to the uk or rep ireland i think it would be best practice to keep to geographical terms and use country names only when referring to jurisdictions of the met offices \xcf\x89 janner',0

your welcome to rebut away first off goodday you seem to have a dislike for anything other than english being on wikipedia even though there is no english equivalent word as shown in this diff you were told by almost everyone an alternative name in english could not be used as there were none now that is a shut and closed case as the votes proved i believe you were the only one other than the proposer who agreed to move the article name your only reply was that you were not going to change your mind i can not understand why you did not understand the reasoning for not changing is it because you are stubborn perhaps i noticed before you saying similar things at different articles perhaps it is because you are too stubborn i would rather that than think you just dislike every language other than english secondly and this one is close to my heart i am starting to think you continually and without being encouraged in any way enjoy telling scots welsh and english people that you only look on them as british whether or not they self identify as scotswelsh or english you even brought your last discussion on it from elonkas talk page just to get it up and running even going so far as to question whether scotland should have their own football league participating in europe you then go on to say that you know nothing of football which makes me wonder why you would comment on something you know nothing about all this makes me wonder why is it because you srongly believe that quebec should not be independent from canada and your bringing your unionist view onto the uk article of course there is one way for me to avoid all this on your talkpage and that is to take it off my watchlist and i have already done that you are still welcome on mine even if i will no longer post on yours',0

cash i am a walmart assocate and i do feel there is a link between walmart managment and servant leadership and here is why the managers are not in charge of the store the hourly associates are they take orders directly from the customers the customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on this is a backwards model that was set fourth by sam walton himself and is maintained by the current board grassroots survays are conducted every mos to a year this survey is a rating of each manager and is then reviewed by the district and regional vp then changes are made each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates and so it is kinda a pushpull managment system take my own situation for an example heres what happend one night i am short of assocates in the deliwhich is where i work temp logs did not get done of course this is a major mistake i was written up for this however i did not feel this was fair so i wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation he then forwarded the matter to our regional vp our vp came to our store flew in from bentonville mind you to deal with the situation he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates after a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the written warning however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short would be on probation for the next six months i was satisfied with the outcome because while i was not fault free in the situation management however was informed that i did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs and they failed to act accordingly and i was not happy with it so in the end i punished them for their poor perfomance so you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership also cash i hate the way you term vast leftwing conspiracy i am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal that would be your union leaders and rightwing large business owners that are antiwalmart as much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you rightwingers because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters vote on the liberal side this does not mean that they are liberals just that they play the politics game true liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business with a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you lol on the part about this entry being pov it is very much so pov however i have given up tring to balance it out myself the antiwalmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits its a freaking joke the way they act however i have just taken on the idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of bs it is',1

rajputs not rajasthanisright p prof hancock is studies mention that the romani people are most closely related to the punjabis and rajputs i am pretty sure not rajasthanis he calls protoromani rajputic the distinction is important if they are partly descended from rajputs who were never really confined to any one part of india that would explain the linguistic variation within the indic words in romani for example why the use of o instead of aa at the end of masculine nounsadjectives in romani this is certainly a characteristic of gujarati and sindhi but is it a characteristic of rajasthani languages anyway if i am wrong in making the last change i made as of now i will be happy to revert it myself oh of course',0

nn pov material is not notable and appears to be a pov push against the subject the band insane clown posse structural bias in article title gay icp as well delete of course i am the nominator comment on further inquiry article gay icp seems to be the worst creation of huh has not kasreyn vandalized the main icp page why is this here any claims on sexual preferences of the band belong on the band article icp but kasreyn has edited this addition and many others out because it did not coincide with his pov keep it per nom keep it as above ultimus t c e comment i am seeing very strong support here does anyone agree this is a case for a speedy delete what been hearing voices kasreyn aside from your numerous comments kasreyn i do not see much support of your pov comment i would not speedy delete this article i disagee that this material is unreliablei think it is notable and not designed to bias the subject any more than it would be to say that charles nelson reilly is gay that said i do believe that the structural bias in the article title is unacceptable so this article should probably be deleted but its content merged with the main article i think it is a biased attempt by fans of icp to keep this information out of the main article and that the creator of this article was taking a valid stand by creating it if icp fans are putting their own pov in the article comment i am not sure on what grounds you can propose to delete this article or a remove it from the main icp article comment it is that noteworthy and verified the text makes a reference to an interview in a magazine i have found the source of the material the article lists four references which are quite relevant information and are only there to make the article more substantial personally i am not a fan of the group or their style of music and do not care if the statements are true or false i am just trying to preserve the integrity of the article if you can show me one valid reason for deletion then i would consider supporting removing this from wiki save it i personally verified these sources and they all exceed expectations riviting stuff people riddlebox wraithz hold on per all the lovely comments above i do not think it is speedyible under wikipedian legislation at all northenglish interesting it is interesting and more than just pov since it is verifiably true it might be worth briefly mentioning it in the main icp article as well agreed per nom',0

david shankbone is traumatizing notable authors david shankbone is attitude toward authors who do not like the photos he is taken of them is bossy and bullying he takes disastrous photos of authors taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible see edmund white am homes francine prose kathryn harrison mary gaitskill it is gotten to the point that authors he has not assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he will be there waiting for them i do not spend much time on wikipedia but when i come upon an author is page with a terrible photo i now know it is been taken by david shankbone i became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he would taken of them so i went and looked back in the history of a couple of them first i checked in the history of am homes and sure enough someone tried to take down the shankbone photo possibly even am homes herself or someone close to her saying it was not a good photo and he repeatedly put it back i also looked in the history of sharyn november and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead but he would not let her have her way and i do not remember the details but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy she quickly backed down sweetly a few days ago i came upon yet another disastrous author photo by david shankbone and decided to google his name because i have been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors frustrations with this offensive photographer i wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it i did not dig very deeply but did find that on february th lots of wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with david shankbone in a section called does wikipedia want david shankbone or should we just tell him to leave to the point that he promised he would leave wikipedia he should not make promises he will not keephe did not even leave for one day as far as i can see from his list of contributions all those posts from upset people have been deleted from wikipedia but i was able to find them by going into the history of the page wikipediaadministrators noticeboardincidents authors are not the only celebrities shankbone has upset i came upon discussions on wikipedia about the actor mike farrell who was upset by the photo shankbone took of him but shankbone insisted his photo stay up on farrell is page it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else and i am sure it is happened to countless other \xe2\x80\x9cnotables\xe2\x80\x9d many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their wikipedia pages either because they do not know how to take down photos and post messages on wikipedia or because they fear that fighting david shankbone will be futile and will only increase their distress authors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance why make it worse and why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down as with any contributor to wikipedia david shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free he claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his but this is clearly not true in many instances given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article david shankbone might be using wikipedia to try and make a career for himself and maybe that is okay but he is hurting a lot of people along the way i am an author with a few published books and there is a page on me on wikipedia that is why i care about this issue i am appalled at what david shankbone is doing to authors as i do not know the best place to post this message i am posting it in three places david shankbone is talk page jimbo wales talk page and wikipediaadministrators noticeboardincidents',0

i think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage so i will no longer link to the wikipedia clan davidson article and will link to the correct history according to the highland manuscript believed to be written by one maclauchlan bearing the date and containing an account of the genealogies of highland clans down to about the year which was accepted as authoritative by skene in his celtic scotland and believed to embody the common tradition of its time the origin of the davidsons is attributed to a certain gilliecattan mhor chief of clan chattan in the time of david i this personage it is stated had two sons muirich mhor and dhai dhu from the former of these was descended clan mhuirich or macpherson and from the latter clan dhai or davidson sir aeneas macpherson the historian of the clan of that name states that both the macphersons and the davidsons were descended from muirich parson of kingussie in the twelfth century you suck and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but i am sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view like i said this page is utter bunk filled with nothing but false information and i am done with it because there are plenty of sites out there that actually have legitimate information gee it certainly is funny how i keep getting very distant genetic matches to members of clan chattan that are not related to the norman comyn scum cheers',1

i thought it might better fit as a first or second sentence because a statement about the mission of the organization strikes me as more of a topic sentence for a paragraph than a supporting sentence it seemed to better fit the first paragraph as on my reading the second paragraph seems to summarize biographical information while the first paragraph defines the group and its reason for notability however i can see it as a topic sentence of the second paragraph with something like the splc describes its mission as fighting hate and bigotry and to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of society or maybe you can show a draft of the variant you had in mind',0

there is already the article religious views on masturbation you might ponder that wikipedia is not all that onesided it is just that in health matters apply wprsmed and wpmedassess not religious or popular opinion we do not pander to popular opinion we follow the medical consensus and the scientific consensus in psychology unless you have mainstream academic sources showing that mds and psychologists do not consensually agree that masturbation is a healthy and normal habit you are not entitled to modify the article according to your musings nobody denied that people feel shame about masturbating but medically and psychologically seen masturbation is healthy and perfectly normal it is just not something one does in public or brags about you might ponder that not only sex therapists which you more or less called them perverts agree on this but mds in general and psychologists in general although consensus is not unanimity so there may be some fringe mds and psychologists who hold weird views about masturbation eg i have searched the whole dsmivtr for the keyword masturbation and nowhere is it considered a disease it is considered problematic only when done in public overtly or when it leads to other health problems such as encopresis when produced by anal masturbation it is also mentioned in connection with the chinese superstitious belief that loss of semen produces the shenkui syndrome',0

pictures and copyright hey i really appreciate the excellent work you have done expanding cuisine of cambodia the article looks much better now than it did a couple of weeks ago i just wanted to tell you a couple of things the beautiful image of num bachok that you have been trying to add to the article is taken from this site if you look at the bottom of that page you can see the the website is copyright this means that wikipedia cannot use the image in the encyclopedia without getting in trouble if you have a picture of num bachok that you have taken and would like to allow wikipedia to use freely you can upload it here then see wikipediapicture tutorial for instructions on how to add your image to the article the second thing is that i have edited out two lines from the article about people in phnom penh your text said many of the khmers who knew how to cook authentic khmer cuisine before the civil war were killed during the khmer rouge regime very few cambodians know how to cook real khmer cuisine if you visit phnom penh today the khmer food now tastes more like thai because the people of phnom penh came from refugee camps so did not know the real features of authentic of khmer cuisine the first part maybe true because so many people were killed during the kr regime however the next two lines are only an opinion and probably not true so i have removed them if you can find a reliable source that says those things then you should add the text back to the article with a reference to the source thanks again for expanding the article with so much good information about tasty khmer food i love it too',0

that is a difficult question i think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a daytoday basis in every discussion we have on wp whether on an article talk page a deletion discussion or at vp maybe there could be a guideline or even just an essay urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation maybe there already is one somewhere and reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work you may have settled on what you think governs the issue but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance to do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines yeah all that should be written down somewhere if it is not already in another guideline for people to cite i think also we could go policy by policy guideline by guideline and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear what does it substantively accomplish that may not always be evident it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why a history of how the policy was written could be interesting but maybe not that helpful and it would be difficult to summarize just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies the village pump or even user talk pages talk',0

i have worked in digital cash for about years it is clear that digital bearer token money ie chaumian blinded money could be used to represent arbitrary assets there is a difference between distributed and centralized systems and right now the only really viable distributed model is blockchain based but the distinction should not be cryptocurrency vs noncryptocurrency but blockchainbased cryptocurrency vs blinded token cryptocurrency they are both distinct from accountbased money there are ways in which blinded money is actually more cryptocurrency than blockchain money by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or accountbased systems blinded tokens are inherently fungible which supports negotiability and finality i am not sure what the solution is to this article move it enmasse to blockchain currency or merge with bitcoin and then redirect cryptocurrency to digital cash',0

history is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most natasha history is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most history is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most however its significance is prodigious and i believe it should be taught to all university students as a required subject because it expands knowledge reflects the present issue and impresses friends history tells us the stories from long time ago reading a history book is like traveling back in time to live in an alien era it enables us to discover the origin of our lives to satisfy our curiosity and understand the cultural differences to help us live in harmony with peculiar customs history untangles the mysteries in the past and assists us in the comprehension of both others and ourselves history conveys important messages that assist us in dealing with present situations by studying the past we can efficiently overcome the obstacles at hand by emulating the previous success and by drawing lessons from the earlier failure \xe2\x80\x9cdday\xe2\x80\x9d for instance could not have been such a successful raid if the allies had not formulated the winning strategy derived from the disastrous attack on dieppe in in short history reflects the present and teaches us how to face upcoming adversities furthermore knowing history is always a good way to show off around our friends if we have accumulated rich knowledge of history then when we go to a museum with our friends we will guide them around and instruct them about the derivation of each item they would definitely be surprised and exclaim in admiration if learning history can bring astonishment in friends\xe2\x80\x99 faces then it is worthwhile time flies and we humble earthly creatures only live in the present and yearn for the future for the distant past we are not privileged to see with our own eyes but by learning history and utilizing all the historic records stored in libraries we are able to find out what was happening even in the distant past',0

i am so set on getting the article deleted because it is been clear to me that the subject is not actually all that bright he is being reported as the highly intelligent by some sources where the reporters do not know what they are talking about and people who do not know anything are somehow taking personal offense whenever anyone suggests that he simply does not know what he is talking about his supposed computations disproving big bang cosmology also sound suspiciously like creationist fakery',0

editing on hypertension hi docjames as a long time wikipedia watcher i feel like i am talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages i am a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently and now that i am getting to the end of my training i would love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training as you can see i am fairly new to the editing scene so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated regarding my recent edits on the hypertension article as i mentioned in the talk page i am basically trying to find a way to get rid of the daunting wall of text problem that i feel the article has at the moment i would like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering what is that can browse with relative ease as such i feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content most of which is only relevant to medical professionals on specific pages and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points let me know what you think about this approach and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit',0

nationality hellooo you seem confident in your knowledge well let me correct you on just a few things firstly speaking as one who has lived in an english speaking country since he was born the word nationality has two meanings in any good detailed dictionary to which ethnic group or its nearest description is both the first of the two as well as the one which originally defined the word in the uk people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the hell they mean ask me i have been there thousands of times as for citizenship means nationality that too is inaccurate citizenship is merely one form of that type of nationality legal individual status the second description there are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances finally if as you say the english language nationality means legal status why apply it to a politician where is the sense in a swedish citizennational running affairs in malta unless he were maltese by some form of documentation there would be a conflict of interest and even if you can answer that one perhaps you should check ibrahim rugova remember him what does it say on his nationality or will you poke fun at the user who submitted his entry',0

alright that does it please avail yourself to read wpnotwikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information specifically point wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information that something is true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia while there is a continuing debate about the encyclopedic merits of several classes of entries current consensus is that wikipedia articles are not directories directory entries or a resource for conducting business for example an article on a radio station generally should not list upcoming events current promotions phone numbers etc although mention of major events or promotions may be acceptable furthermore the talk pages associated with an article are for talking about the article not for conducting the business of the topic of the article this page is about homosexuality in singapore not a directory of where you can go to make out with other men in singapore if you are a gay that information is too trivial and nonencyclopedic to be included here i also happen to be one of the greatest homophobes the world has every seen',0

white light is a wavefront with powerenergy equally distributed across the visible frequency spectrum when the wavefront has power levels distributed at different frequencies so that some parts the spectrum have more or less power then we call that a color the wavefront that impacts the eye to produce the sensation of magenta has high power levels in the lower and higher frequencies and low power levels in the center frequencies it is just one wavefront but shaped in power intensity vs frequency there is no such thing as different colors of light waves only a wavefront that has a power vs frequency shape as such there are not incoming different frequencies of light to produce a color its just one wavefront no separate blue or red light enters the eye to be combined and produce a color the color is inherent in the energy distribution of the wavefront which stimulates the frequency sensitive biological receptors in proportion to the power levels within the wavefront it is for this reason that magenta is as are all colors spectral it is the energy vs frequency distribution of the incoming wavefront that produces the perceived color sensation any color you like can be produced by a single tunable light source through modulation one wavefront not seperate incoming light colors',0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with',0

probability or decision ild like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff martin is remark the answer is and mine no the answer is switch i did not mean to imply that the should be made completely invisible of course one must emphasize that a good reason to switch is because the probability is that you will get the car this way it is even a very very good reason to switch since it is can be shown if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car that you can not do better in particular complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success morgan et al gill i hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it is possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with and which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature remember vos savant and whitaker ask what the player should do introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action the phrase the probability leads straight to controversy at least to disagreement both among editors and in the literature the phrase what action should the player take leads to concensus both among editors and in the literature it is just meant to be a small practical concensus building suggestion',0

zora and aiden you being nonmuslims assume being allknowing about islam and consider me as an ignorant muslims who misinterprets his religion thanks really for your kind attitude i was talking at an scholarly level quoting verses from quran you can not revert my edits wholesale just because you do not like them and post your own interpretation there i do not like to get into a revert war though i am pretty sure that my edits are quite justified and i will be the one who will eventually win the debate you can always add the pov tag to the section and try to find the opinion of other scholars or quote other quranic verses regarding your point doing original research i would like to say that it is just an excuse and maybe a good strategy to quite the beginners if we really do not want to do any original research many parts of many articles in wikipedia should be deleted all the articles will become mere quotes from several scholars without any glue to keep different quotes together you statement that i am doing original research is by itself an original research it is strange to me that somebody claims that hisher understanding of islam is authentic and the others are just original researchs',0

thanks but i did contact the admin who stuck my name on there i did not get a response i removed my own declaration and name did not consider that a revert at the time just an edit the only thing i considered a revert was actually reverting when someone cheekily readded it i reverted under wplibel and left the following details on ani i have never in my entire wiki history or life intently read or edited any articles or biog relating to the troubles it does not interest me one iota my name on that list was defamatory and i exercised wplibel to remove it and to save time getting it suppressed it is common sense and normal reasoning that we do not identifyban someone as a sex offender without proof and you just as equally do not list them on a public website where i am not anonymous as being involved in highly contentious and potentially incriminating topics which people might take literally and use against them even life threatening the admin was wrong in his suppositions the underlying comparison was wrong the warning does not apply to me might as well try to warn me not to waredit in theory holocaustdenial or farright political party discussions the fact that i never have or do prevails over such notices as does upholding agf in acknowledging that i do not the admin was advised of my removing the entry and has not taken the matter any further and neither should anyone else \xe2\x80\x93 let sleeping dogs lie and no one will have excuses to cast spurious remarks if libellous remarks can be removed from blps under wp rrno i assume too they can be removed under a similar rrno situation despite not having a mainspace article on me i am a living person and have rights to privacy too as much as any blp this listing is a threat to my privacy and safety under wiki is own policy i do not need to threaten legal riffraff wikipedian is should know this is not a safe way to expose people i feel even more exposed by it being raised again these talk pages are open scanned by bots and all sorts which compromises anonymity this is not a good compromise the physical safety and wellbeing of people is more important than the protection of a few bytes data on some articles \xc2\xa0chat\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0rff',0

wpconsensus does not mean democracy see wpnot just because the gay wikiproject believes things should be done a certain way and there is little dissent within the wikiproject does not mean that this is how things should be done in articles seemingly important to their eyes after all james is a political and religious figure infitessimally more important to analyze or discuss in much less personal terms than having to do with sexuality or other habits after all james wrote a treatise on smoking as repellant but this is not so big a deal because of its lack in uniqueness or value in comparison to his policies most gay wikiproject participants admittedly find james a guilty hypocrite for all done in his name by fundamentalists against gays this is essentially the problem the gay wikiproject is taking a side and setting it into stone all the while decrying persecution when the odds and ends of wikipedians here and there in the wikipedia community find a problem with saying that james was indeed gay without proof just a conflict of views that are veritably lost in time the gay wikiproject takes speculation and purposeful homophobic defamation of the king is character and turn it into a monumental case or trial on homosexuality probably about the king is motives in the king james version bible and verses used to support condemnation of homosexuality do not take this personal the life of james has everything to do with a new and unstable sometimes tyrannical government in power it has little veracity with regards to sexual conspiracies unless one follows the king is involvement in aid to favourite robert carr earl of somerset in trying to take another man is wife by murdering her legal husband this of course is hardly homosexual',0

well maybe i will just do a seperate article about the hacking itself and then with a brief mention in the kunis page put a link to that hacking articl here in case anyone wants to go see it the effect on her was not as great as the singer christina or the two nudes of johannson and certainly not as bad as what happened to olstead who had extremely explicit pics of her released but kunis was mentioned in the indictment and mentioned in all the news articles about this plus she did give a front page interview to harper is bazar in which she also discussed it to just ignore the fact that she was a victim of a seriouse crime sounds like white washing to me plus it denigrates her status as an innocent victim of a federal offense and a gross violation of her privacy what happened happened and white washing will not make it go away but i like the idea of making a completely seperate article on the hacking as a whole and then mkaing a link to the two sentences made by bbb here in case people want more',0
notable important hello please do not use the word important when talking about notability as you did at wphdzeeshan haider in this case it probably does not matter because the issue is that the article does not make a claim of notability but when an article is deleted or rejected because the subject is not notable new users often come back with something like how can you say x is not important the answer is that that is not what we are saying notable has a technical meaning in wikipedia and does not mean important influential popular or any of the other things that people might interpret it as being in the normal sense for an example where i made this point and another editor took me to task for nitpicking and then came back and apologised when he saw a new user make exactly that misinterpretation see user talkcolinfinearchive your comment',0

do not you understand that what is commonly called nazi punk does not have to mean one being politically a national socialist if you bother to read the first paragraph in the article punk bands and individuals who are believers in extreme nationalism fascism racialism or national socialism are considered nazi punks abh were white power racialists and extremely nationalistic at one point in their career and therefore by wikipedia and common scene definition a nazi punk band they fall under two of the qualifications i know that a lot of people like abh and have an interest in others not thinking they were white nationalists but the fact remains they were at one point despite the fact they later changed their views perhaps putting a sidenote saying that the band later changed their views should be added but that is it this article is a historical look at the nazi punk ie racist punk subculture and white washing certain band is histories is not right and should not be tolerated i am readding them',0

that is not what the footnoted verifiable section you deleted was the very term wage slavery originates from the comparison of wage labor with chattel slavery the section quotes relevant sources and the comparisons put forth by the very originators of the term as well as quotes from people who disagreed with it such as the description of wage workers as wage slaves was not without controversy many abolitionists in the us including northern capitalists regarded the analogy to be spurious they believed that wage workers were neither wronged nor oppressed the abolitionist and former slave frederick douglass declared now i am my own master when he took a paying job furthermore you lk and other critics already took months editing that very section in the past your sudden reaction of deleting such a huge section seems to have questionable motivations',0

so let is cut this down to the convention for wikipedia we already discussed the issue at wikipediawikiproject automobilesconventions and decided to use hp presumably sae net or gross depending on time period or kw depending on market for this unit i am opposed to using ps or metric horsepower it is just plain confusing one exception is if the metric hp number is significant as in the bugatti veyron with it is hp metric engine i will propose an ammendment over there to always specify hp sae rather than just hp and see what people think or we could just link the first occurrence of hp to horsepowerhp sae and let people use their intiution that all remaining references to hp are for sae numbers i like this better we do have to be precise and i do not want to go around using random units everywhere so let is decide here and now i propose never using metric horsepower as a primary unit unless it is a special case like the bugatti and then we should be very specific in including the sae number we have already decided to always include both hp and kw and that is all well and good as for notation if we are to specify sae i would do it without parentheses since we are using the parens for kw already so we say \xc2\xa0hp sae \xc2\xa0kw i would rather not include the sae at all but this is a reasonable alternative may utc',0

is brian really an atheist in the recently aired episode april in quahog brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth also at the end of the episode brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen based on the context of the situation and stewie is remark in the background that the someone brian made a deal with was god this calls brian is atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along there are only two other explanations for this series of events that i can think of one would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of there are no atheists in foxholes though this is unlikely because brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear would not do let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike mcfarlane the other would be that mcfarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples work righteous attitude towards religion however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke an in depth understanding of what christianity actually teaches would be required which most people including mcfarlane likely do not posses forceofdarkness',0

deletion votes and username thanks for the advice on the deletion votes i will try to be more descriptive of why i think these things should be kept however it was not my understanding that a vote would be discounted simply because no explanation was given re my username while i understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral accurate encyclopedia creative and innovative approaches are helpful i believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities many people who say they are against trolling are actually when you talk to them about it against vandalism personal attacks or timewasting none of which i condone i think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community and more willing to try to understand each other in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible thanks for you advice hope to see you around mar utc',0

sorry dude as a physicist i know that there is not any generally accepted position on whether the universe had a prime mover or whether one was necessary or not or whether there is a necessary being our only two cites for this section which claims the argument has been scientifically refuted which is not true are a popular science book and a popular science lecture now i am not disrespecting kaku or hawking but hawking is statement that there was not time before the universe began is not his it goes back to augustine of hippo which hawking says in i believe a brief history of time and so is not in opposition to any basic christian philosophy about god and as i pointed out physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang it is not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim and kaku is description of the molecules in the jar not being moved as i pointed out is not motion from nothing the molecules had to have a probability or potential to move the reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle when you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics that is implying a cause there was a cause for the motion or the creation not something out of nothing now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing and where did they come from hawking i believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function see hartlehawking state but where did that come from and this idea as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists so unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted not that they just do not personally accept it or something like that we should not be making that claim for instance the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy makes no such claim and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis and as for popular science sources carl sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science',0

september utc lol regardless of intent or accident i actually wish that goingbatty would listen to my request and avoid pages that i am working on goingbatty was and still is not interested in brazilian hip hop unless he is a secret gangster rapper maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap anyway i am bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists conservatives protectors of childhood nationalists etc i imagine that many of the neonazi groups are here also its my experience of rightwingers that on the whole they do not want you to know what they are up too i remember an arts center open mic night which i was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them it was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform the woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the bnp british national party worked and put one of them in charge i emailed the arts center due to the fact that i knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views a week or two later i received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both i am not too sure why but i do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small bnp cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished she was colored he said something that was really strange i can not say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist about a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react after all he was in charge now that is power when you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie well that is political power its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy it is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma here is what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the bnp and i spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council i sent an email to my council of course evidently my council believe that hiring a bnp member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in england was fine because his racist views should not affect his ability to provide good advice lol',0

thank you i would rather discuss the generic effects of the longstanding and widespread violation of wpnor and wpnpov here and leave the discussion of specific content issues to the rest of the talk page which is its function the generic problem with the article is that rather than presenting divergent multiple viewpoints of a topic the article often attempts a topic synthesis prohibited by wpnor which presents every viewpoint incorrectly or incompletely violation of wpnpov for reference i quote with added emphasis from wikipediafive pillars about wpnpov wikipedia has a neutral point of view which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view presenting each point of view accurately providing context for any given point of view so that readers understand whose view the point represents and presenting no one point of view as the truth or the best view it means citing verifiable authoritative sources whenever possible especially on controversial topics talk',0

unblock request fuck you unblock me unblockhahaahahahahahahaha unblock me or i will vandalise more it had been six years since we had graduated from college and for the first time since graduation all three of us were together again from the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable having returned to my cozy semisecluded home in the suburbs we all sat in the living room sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives with the exceptions of the location \xe2\x80\x93 a house \xe2\x80\x93 and the presence of alcohol it could have been any of our final two years of college together the three of us tightknit friendswithbenefits sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together then justine and beth had been roommates while i lived in another dorm across the main quad now they were muchwelcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend as i sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine i allowed my eyes to truly linger on justine as she told beth about a recent situation at work the florida sun had certainly added a glow to justine is skin and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulderlength brown hair as when we were in college together she wore virtually no makeup just a thin gloss upon her lips \xe2\x80\x93 an enticing strawberry flavor as i had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening \xe2\x80\x93 and red fingernails her red dress was indeed elegant with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage a display which beth and i both certainly appreciated the long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the welltoned thigh the red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes surprisingly however she wore hoop earrings something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe the conversation turned back toward me but a few minutes later the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other i took the opportunity to once again study beth and was equally impressed while noticeably shorter than justine beth was also paler in complexion a testament to living in northern canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research as in college beth preferred the color black for her outfits a somewhattight sweater formfitting slacks and a pair of low heels four tiny earrings adorned each ear plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril beth is black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to justine it felt so good to be in their presence once again especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college i was thankful that i had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me i had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy but for now i was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa the intimacy began when we finally went to bed together i was on my back under the covers with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder an arm wrapped around each of them i held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest dipped a finger into my navel brushed my thighs through the sweatpants i typically wore to bed caressed my stiffening manhood my eyes closed i reveled in their touches inherently familiar yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time no words were needed and as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me i smiled to myself in the darkness having always enjoyed watching beth and justine in their own intimate encounters but eventually their touches slowed and ultimately ceased their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep i stayed awake a little longer immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life i awoke in the morning to the scent of french roast coffee faint yet unmistakable justine was gone clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar while beth and i held each other as sh',1

the catholic church example is a good one but i would like to point out several key distinctions first off its an old enough institution that a separate history of the catholic church article exists which makes the main article in reality the current status of the catholic church or maybe a summary of the catholic church this is not the case for the nra we have a single article that is trying to address its entire history along with its cumulative activities so the lead needs to reflect that second with all of the various controversy involving the church none of it mentioned until the last paragraph third it is lead st sentence is fairly generic simply stating that its the largest organization of its type and how many members it has i would be fine with something similar the national rifle association of america nra is a nonprofit organization with million members but quite frankly that seems too simplistic and not terribly descriptive or informative furthermore if we take a clinical look at what they do today its a variety of things that range from publishing and multimedia television internet etc to training and certification programs to historical preservation along with lobbying and other political activities so to describe the organization in the st sentence using any kind of phrase that includes gun control gun rights or the like is just bad writing and purposely ignoring significant parts of the article hence my original suggestion for the lead first sentence at the very least i do not see why the first sentence can not just be generically descriptive maybe something like the national rifle association of america nra is a nonprofit organization that primarily serves as an advocate for firearm related issues and activities originally founded in in new york by journal editor william conant church and general george wood wingate to promote marksmanship within the united states military the organization has gone through several transformations as well as expanded its purpose and goals in the st century it has become one of the largest and most influential lobbyist groups in washington dc as well as a large multititle magazine publisher an advocate for hunters outdoorsmen and the and one of the largest firearm training and certification program operators in the us that said i will try to find other examples but given this list category c nonprofit organizations it does not seem difficult to find an article with a lead first sentence like i have described by the way i am advocating for a rewrite of the entire wplead not just the st sentence i think that policy is fairly clear but imo to adhere to it properly in this case editor is need to quote the wplead page a specialized understanding of the subject in order to write it in a npov manner that a nonspecialist will understand this is something beyond what a magazine subscription or occasional mailing will provide talk \xe2\x98\xae\xe1\x83\xa6\xe2\x98\xba',0

ive changed the heading of what was the physics section because it appeared to have nothing much to do with physics i made a new physics description and put it at the top but i think it generally covers what most people know of as distance i deleted the distinctions of distance that had been written that said things like the distance formula is not true for curved surfaces which cant be true because the distance formula is part of the law of physics and is always true they were true in a general sense but i didnt see how they had any useful meaning if someone understands the special theory of reletivity better than i do can they please give some information on how distance applies generally in physics ive been thinking that it might be overkill to seperate this topic into physicsgeometrymaths because distance is all of them at once and it doesnt need to be explained over and over in slightly different senses',0

i actually was never carrying an id while walking down the streets in russia in most cases this is not needed and it is not compulsory by law if you travel by train or air you must have an id with you but in the usa you also need an id to travel by air do not you the police have the right to request your id only if you are a crime suspect i believe this is the same in the usa is not it the problem is that this right is easy to abuse in russia especially in bigger cities policemen can claim you resemble someone wanted and place you in custody until your identity is determined but not longer than for some time which i do not remember now they would release you from custody for a small amount of money unofficially paid to them the problem is thus not in the law but in the improper conduct of policemen identity cards or passports are compulsory in many countries see listofidentitycardpoliciesbycountry the usa is more like an exception actually',0

reforming wikipedia is an impossible feat i fail to see positive improvement on articles i find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much the ability for growth is stifled i have seen of maya books and articles use ahau instead of spanish ajaw yet the editors of wikipedia like to stand out as different only a hispanic would promounce ajaw as ahau is wikipedia starting the new favored way i find that is what happens to words in the is the egyptian god re was spelled in british manner where re is pronounced as ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows so the americans changed it to ra and no one says ray they all say rah do this for years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language can hearts of men reform please prove my doubts they will i think truth is stifled and smothered war exists even without religion because religion is not mere organized armies religion is also mere individual political belief or personal concepts of what is true and it will rally people it does right here and in chats and in bulletins woul not be caught by name on here you all make me shame to be on candidate for improvement',0

connecting all of reality together you wrote the problem is well let is pull up a solid midlist marvel character speedball word article only words of that pertain to the real world instead of the fictional world of the comics that is the problem fancruft is in many ways a poor choice of terms for this especially since it is not even necessarily the case that the information itself is the problem the problem is that virtually the entire article was written so as to pertain to the marvel universe with occasional citations of issue number here which made me think of the problems in articles about economic systems in which enthusiasts pro and con anarchism and communism and capitalism go on and on and on with pie in the sky theories and barely coming down from their clouds long enough to source ideas much less tie ideas to concrete real word implementations of ideas see mixed economy for the real world which made me think of wikipediarequests for arbitrationpseudoscienceworkshop\xe2\x80\x8e in which the science is based on evidence clan does battle with the ideas are science too clan in the field of cosmology as it related to plasma which made me think of logical positivism which holds that all knowledge should be based on logical inference from observable facts which made me think of our troubles in wording wikipediaattribution\xe2\x80\x8e the point of attribution is credibility which is achieved with an internal consistancy combined with connecting it all to objective reality sounds like our pop culture articles need to be grounded to objective reality to a greater degree which reminds me of answering because the author thought it would sell books when asked why a fictional character displayed a certain psychological trait by an english teacher in my youth but i digress',0

deletion of leigh arnold re leigh arnold i am just wondering how an article by and for the actress leigh arnold could be a copyright infringement if you could clarify this it would be great and i will gladley correct if any errors but this is biographical so not too sure the text was copied from this page which is marked at the bottom \xc2\xa9 leigh arnold that makes it a copyvio but in any case the text is not quite what we want here so providing you have no coi feel free to write a bio in your own words including references \xe2\x80\x94 rhaworth\xc2\xa0',0

i just want to thank you for your efforts on this article there are a number of people on wikipedia that go to any length to criticize lawyers maybe sometimes with good reason often with no good reason it was lawyers that finally exposed the coverup of asbestos i just wish it had occurred much earlier than it did today our family finally received a small settlement from babcoxwilcox twenty four years after my dad died from mesothelioma and two years after my mother died frankly i had forgotten about it i am sure my mother would have wished her last years to have been with her husband i know i missed having a dad was that worth not on your life all that did for me is bring back memories and the kind of grief that has never gone away not even after years please do not stop contributing information on these issues the history of asbestos is or should be a cautionary tale of what happens when we believe corporations will self regulate out of their own self interest ayn rand was not a historian she was a fiction writer it is a shame that some people do not seem to understand the difference',0

it appears to be okay now i wonder why this keeps occurring \xe2\x80\x94 wikipedia links turn red on occation on wikiversity as well it is like the database splits main page layout hello i am sure this has been asked before but i can not find the information anywhere can someone direct me to an article on how to remove the title from the article for example on my wiki the main page always says main page on top and i would like to remove it thanks in advance also if you can also point me to where i can change the article tab on top to main page that would be great too thanks again i do not know much about this but perhaps it is the skin you are using go to my preferenses then skin and select monobook unfortunately you can only do this if you log in or create an account talk this is a technical question about the mediawiki software best asked on wikipediavillage pump technical it is not difficult to do this but it would require code changes i believe this is done in mediawikimonobookjs with the following lines of code var mptitle main page var ismainpage documenttitlesubstr documenttitlelastindexof mptitle var isdiff documentlocationsearch documentlocationsearchindexofdiff documentlocationsearchindexofoldid if ismainpage isdiff documentwrite lastmod sitesub contentsub h firstheading display none important correct me if wrong but i think all you have to do is add these lines to monobookjs this would be good to add to the main page faq talk contribs thanks for all your help with your input i was able to google search for the very answer to my solution here basically its like you guys said edit the usernamemonobookjs page or mediawikimonobookjs if you want to change it for the entire site just search for that page and append the extra code my apologies if this posting is located in the wrong area i simply could not find any other spot to leave this message thanks again september suggestion i think that adding a link to the sandbox in a prominent place not in the small print will help new users to find a right place to experiment and not carry out trial edits on actual pages my hypothesis is that this will noticeably reduce unconstructive edits falling under the new user test category any support for my theory firstly i think it is a good thing that random tests can occur in main space it rams home the fact that wikipedia can be edited by anyone the only way for some people to believe this is to try it secondly even after the header redesign for this page with the red flashing lights many people still do not notice it but even after my disparigment i am not against including a link to the sandbox somewhere more prominent where do you suggest i suggest with the overview \xc2\xb7 searching \xc2\xb7 editing \xc2\xb7 questions \xc2\xb7 help part the one under the welcome to wikipedia box with a brief explanation of what it is for in brackets so new users know what it is for and do not get perplexed by what they see as yet another confusing feature of wikipedia at the moment at x pixel resolution there is no room for any more links in that area okhow about including it in either the navigation or the toolbox boxes on the left side of the window instead of on the main page that way the sandbox is accessible anywhere without having to know what to type into the search field or having to go back to the main page which might achieve my aim better since it is less troublesome to go to the sandbox ,0

vandalism sorry mister but i have not conducted vandalism a single time and all of my edits so far notify me if any of them are not contributive or factually correct are legit edits fuck off was because of the overwhelming amount of obvious facts being asked for citation and was not meant for any specific user is wikipedia this full of bull and i am using a euphenism because i am sure you will refer to assume good faith as soon as you see me using my own rhetoric i am bothered by bull so i am just here nicely removing and being bold about editors screwing up badly ironically i could write some edit summary to this edit like fuck things sure are fucked up pretty fuckily around fucky here regarding the dumb in the fact that i had not attacked anyone specifically give me one evidence where i had mentioned a person or a revision oops there is none this is the bull i am talking about please there are better things to worry than to ban some people because of some behind the scene metadata with a little cuss and a preposite hint the fuck off was towards the manners and the piece of template not any person or any group of editors tell me why all my effort in writing good articles using proper punctuation and spelling and using a wikipedialike style is overseen by admins who only look at some edit summaries who nobody really cares about talk',1

anons concerns cont would on the gravlocked red dwarf planet note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like io so it is not as if everything will freeze on the night side the great advantage of a gravlocked planet is its stability i think it is fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability if you look at the stability of jupiter is great red spot years and posited to be permanent weather on a gravlocked planet should be relatively stable i presume a convection rising at the sun pole and falling at the dark pole with terrain eddies of course such a planet will have no axial tilt no daynight cyclei do not even think it can have an eccentric orbit but i am unsure this greatly reduces the complexity of an organism is job for example a plant does not need the night mode earth plants need they would not have to drop leaves for winter these seem like advantages to me based on the best information i can find on the us dept of energy site solar information what plants get on a clear equinox day is about kwhm peaking at kwm the vast majority of that power comes in the middle hours less than kwhm is in morning and evening the night is essentially kwhm not absolutely no but to the digit accuracy i was using yes compare visual magnitudes of sun vs moon this varies by latitude and season of course now let is plug this into the supposedly horrible variation of a red dwarf instead of roughly time at kw yes it really is close to that equivalent energy would be all the time at kw thus the variation would be kw during minimums of kw and of course is kw thus ignoring frequency the red dwarf plant has an easier time the lower power of red dwarfs just pull the hz in considering earth shade plants which live on far less than kwm the hz is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water organizationally perhaps the best thing would be to treat earthlike planets in the main flow of the article then discuss tidallylocked red dwarf planets with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons like titan and europa perhaps keeping original numbers suitable star systems spectral class binary systems since all but the closest binaries are ok put it here a stable habitable zone planetary characteristics mass acceptable energy variation as i hope i showed about low is not really necessary include the case of jovian moons in the hz high metallicity it comes from system formation but it is a planet property geochemistry maybe combine with metallicity alternative biologies red dwarf systems tidally locked low light new chemosynthesisbased biology on no changes i should add this is a really good article maybe i am trying to gild the lily mistake i am not a specialist but mars by contrast is nearly or perhaps totally geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere mass paragraph seems doubtful to me i mean mars still has volcanoes mount olympus for example so it sees strange to me that it is geologically dead but once again i am no specialist mars does have volcanoes but as far as i know they are not really active so nothing is really powering them and geological activity is not really showing up luna earth is moon has volcanoes and it is accepted as geologically dead the presence of volcanoes does not mean active volcanoes that is basically what i was trying to say i guess i just never made it really clear picture size can a larger size by found for the habitability zone picture i would like to use it as a background but it will not scale up i downloaded it here httplibrarythinkquestorg though i can not remember the exact spot on the site an image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing but only at k earth is geological activity i am pretty sure that the earth is not geologically active simply because of its large masssurface area ratio from what i have read i believe that planets are probably heated mostly by radioactive decay andor tidal for',0

may utc my best advice to you is to give it up it is not worth it you can not win when arguing with someone who is respected by the community for some reason some users on here are given a gold star and therefore allowed to do what they want and they usually have admins that they regularly go to when they have problems kinda like a pimp you can argue until you are blue in the face and whether you are right or wrong you are gonna be the one who gets disciplined i know cause it happened to me personally i find it highly disturbing that a user can remove your edits simply by saying it does not meet with the consensus opinion when usually that opinion is only that of said user but apparently there is no way to get an impartial judgement basically he will be allowed to threaten you with all sorts of actions like claiming your sources are not reliable watching and editing every article you touchwhich is incidently happening to me now reporting you blocking you and if you respond in any way that he considers insulting you will be blocked it is not fair i know but welcome to wikipedia light dinamite',0

you remove that part by deleting the codes of the form and leaving in place the stuff between them this is in the standard editor for wikipedia i am not sure exactly how it looks in the visual editor if you are using that but no that would not cause it to become part of the public part of the encyclopedia to do that you would need to move the page from your user space to infinity cat recordings there should be a tab near the top of the page labeled move i would recommend not performing such a move until you have addressed the concerns from the previous deletion discussion because if you move it back into the encyclopedia in its current state it is likely to be quickly deleted again \xe2\x80\x94',0

hi looie thank you for advising me of this appreciated i really do love wikipedia but i must insist that i am allowed to love it on my own terms because i can do no other or go without which i candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear as i think i must surely have made clear i really do have nothing further to add to the comments about buddhist sex abuse cases i have already made i do hope the page is restored currently i am fleshing out the biographies of leveller women i have already supplied a stub for katherine chidley and i am presently working on one for userrinpochemary overton wife of richard overton it will take a few days before it is ready yet mary overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life she was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to millwall prison in londonan absolutely dreadful place she refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away they too refused out of common humanity the bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the london streets while people spat abuse well i do not know but i think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to go fuck yourself which is absolutely frightful of course the baby died some six months later regarding the bsac debacle what i have done with my katherine chidley stub is that on the talk page i have added at the top a section for contributors in which i myself as a contributing editor expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it the lack of a definition for the term controversialist for example which i can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition i will be doing the same in all future new pages i contribute in the hope of avoiding the same difficulties i had with bsac assuming of course that is okay with the wiki community thank you for your attention',0

yes what a great game from what i kept up with from live commentary from eurosport i could tell it was a great game unfortunately my university studies will get in the way of all the champions league games at least for the group stage as over here in toronto they start at pm where my classes are scheduled you have it lucky in itsly where you can watch it after work very upset about it but what are you gonna do i could watch a re run of the game but i can not quite ever get into it because i already know what happens it is not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone i like shouting at the tv screen you probably know the feeling hahaha highlights are he best bet but i know it does not show the full story of the game so i can not banter much but what a game it would have been i am sure i talked to my brother about it though who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it was not for buffon it would be a whole different story i love to see buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top goalkeeper at least this just goes to show that you can not doubt a team is champions league performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league as a true fan you are always rough on your team but always stay by them through thick and thin as you have said this should be a great confidence boost for juve and can hopefully channel it towards serie a and further cl games as there is still a long way to go hopefully juve can win the title for a th straight and prove to all the people that it is roma or inter is time for the scudetto in their place haha regards',0

andy thank you very much what are the locations of those lost buildings all in aachen i was wondering if the holy roman empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of western europe such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as england and other catholic lands as subdivisions during that time the reason being that there was only one emperor during those timesin the west and only after protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of western europe was the king of england a sovereign during the time predating the anglican schism or was he subordinate to the holy roman emperor i postulate this due to the fact that the cardinals and archbishops were subordinate to the pope and figured that there is some part of history not being told to enough children would not that be a reason to break with the vatican back then once henry broke with the church he was able to incorporate wales and the royal house changed from province to surname i was thinking that the provincial royal house like anjou blois or normandy is a continental style once england broke away they went to personal names like tudor and stuarteven though henry was technically of the house of richmond once england had become the center of another empire just of its own they reverted to usage of provincial houses so what do you thinkam i right',0

uv is my error above i am told by kimberly jameson in an email that the fourth range is in or near the reds if i understand correctly at least that it is not uv i now think almost no tetrachromats conversationally distinguish the fourth range but instead almost all have since babyhood been perceiving colors as trichromats do because they are trained that way using pictures and what grownups persistently say conversational tetrachromacy being rare is probably supported by the absence of any support from almost any business especially businesses with customers who are almost all women and which depend on color perception for customer satisfaction since most would be happy to expand their sales by by carrying products for tetrachromats and staffing with a tetrachromat and advertising it but they do not so the incidence of conversational tetrachromacy among adults and adolescents is likely extremely rare',0

unless you have newer statistics those still apply and are valid unless there is some scientific timelimit i am not aware of when something becomes irrelevant is it years or you can always neutralize the sentence by adding according to the survey and it is very much relevant to mention that russian and chinese physical anthropologists largely disagree with the opinions of american and canadian anthropologists because america is not the center of the world and neither is it the authority on race the original current sentence lacks neutrality and is giving all the weight on the side of american anthropologists this even though every single source explicitly says there is no consensus the neutrality issue will be solved once both opinions are expressed i did my best and wrote two what i believe are neutral texts to replace the current one but you disagree with both of them so you propose one i am going to bed and i will give my opinion tomorrow',0

clarification on wikipedia naming standards hi kohikoi you just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discussinvestigate i would like to remind you that wikipediaadministratorcodeofconduct wikipedia admin code of conduct guidelines specifically state threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others to deal with your concerns though from my tandpoint i just corrected a breach of wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated howeveryou just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a longstanding consensus between several users do you have evidence of this consensus ie where exactly is it reported on wikipedia as far as i can tell the page for naming conventions of greek and turkish named places specifically states this wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear if you want to revive discussion regarding the subject you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump furthermore i have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for greekturkish naming conventions in the first place the standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader wikipedia naming standards which state use modern english names for titles and in articles historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers and should be used in articles with caution i am a a hotheaded newb so perhaps i am missing something here any insight would be appreciated',0

thank you gwen for restating my reply to jdlund i also complied with your previous block as to jimbo wales and his claims of years of disruption on this article those are his opinions however of the facts in the article are based on my contributions including my photos of the tower before the university corrupted the tower with it is cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy paint cages and other coverups can not remove the actual history sure there have been previous wars over the content i have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents interviews and real history of the tragedy while trying to correct the media is versions which are full of errors and out right misinformation if some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used houston mccoy would be george mccoy whitman would be the devil or evil read gary lavergne is why did he do it on his website this is the author of a sniper in the tower who claimed the tower tragedy was the worst mass murder in american history which i fought and proved that andrew kehoe was the worst until whitman also in lavergne is article he claims whitman would be alive as of august if the supreme court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy even though whitman had a glioblastoma grade iv brain tumor that would have killed him within a year even if he had not gone up in the tower all jimbo wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like bzuk and gavia immer who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution they gavia and bzuk are just like wales memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing just applying their own personal bias for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism with no proof and not even looking at the contribution and it is sourcing again i have made valid contributions that even gwen admitted would be appropriate if rewritten by a more neutral editor but what doe that mean really',0

the arguments above consist of reiteration i also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production which are also found in animation from other countries whether the usa korea or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market this definition would exclude miyazaki who indeed excludes himself unlike his western fans likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition yes the ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as marveldc superheroes and certainly deserves a specific article but this is not the same as tokusatu ergo tokusatu is not a genre should not be so quick to assume what people do and do not know about my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an iwillnotbequestioned tone and i certainly know enough to contribute to this article however i strongly disagree with the classification and crufty tone and thus will not usage on the japanese wikipedia does not have any bearing the large number of separate articles on japanrelated topics that could well be included under the more general headings is definitely a fandriven form of exceptionalism',0

maybe irrelevant was not the ideal word choice i would not remove a photo of a bostonlocated school from the boston page but i would be a bit skeptical of its inclusion it is just that there are something like schools in the metroboston area even if you limit it to the more notable ones mit harvard bc bu berklee emerson suffolk others i am probably forgetting which one do you pick you can not put an image for every campus into that section so which one is sufficiently representative also i get the impression there is a minor status war between bc or bu and probably other schools regarding which one is depicted as the best school on wikipedia so i think edits like the bc photo addition that could potentially be construed as marketing should be closely scrutinized what do you think',0

i i have moved this from haematology to keep the american spelling into wikipedia however much i abhor the dropping of aes from all those bloody words like hemoglobin ischemia and the like mar utc the article blood diseases is much better than this page i think these two pages should be merged but not know how to but the merge template on page very simple take the content out of one article put it in the other and then turn the former into a redirect to the latter \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0tlk pages merged lists need a lot of work insert nonformatted text here insert nonformatted text here insert nonformatted text here inexplicable text above line removed from article page does it mean anything it is a newbie test resulting from clicking the buttons above the edit window \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0tlk i think that the article hematology should define hematology as in what a hematologist does not blood diseases we should create that article separately i think that haematologist and haematology should remain separate pages they are not the same it is easy to click on a link to look up haematologist on the haematology page i disagree being a hematologist is practicing hematology hematology is not just the diseases but just as much diagnostics epidemiology and laboratory medicine together with gastroenterology it is one of the few fields that has retained its own diagnostic process no need to send the blood film to a dedicated expert i would suggest moving the diseases to a seperate page and using this page to mention the main ones red cells white cells transfusion and coagulation \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0tlk spelling can we please have this page retitled as hematology it is not spelt hematology sorry if american people think it is spelt like that but arggghhh doctors were around in england long before america the language was born here spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid regards i think there is room in the world for both spellings as all things evolve differently in different locations including language and it is details since when were doctors in england before america native americans practiced medicine and if you refer to doctors as practitioners of modern western medicine remember that at the time america became a country doctors were still trying to save people by bleeding them \xe2\x80\x94the preceding unsigned comment was added by there is a redirect from haematology to hematology so we english will find the page the page was at haematology until changed it to hematology in an edit on the th of november apparently in order to keep the american spelling into wikipedia according to wikipedia policy it should have stayed at haematology there is no preference for us english in wikipedia but it has been at the admittedly awful title of hematology for so long trying to get it restored may be something of a fruitless exercise cest la vie i think that probably we should leave it at hematology because moving it would provoke the opposite argument and there is a redirect after all',0

inclusion of school type gender and religious information for hnmcs there have been repeated deletions by mikeycanuck aka which remove pertinent information about holy name of mary college school hnmcs from this article the two schools are brother and sister schools and as per the history section in the hnmcs article the felician sisters and st michael is college school cofounded the independent holy name of mary college school as such it is appropriate to contain some basic information about hnmcs in this article and in the same way to include some basic information about smcs in the holy name of mary college school article the inclusion of the school type independent gender allgirls and religious information catholic of holy name of mary college school in this article is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type private gender allboys and religious information catholic of st michael is college school i do not agree that it is relevant information to give these details about holy name on the smcs wiki people reading the smcs page quickly learn that holy name of mary is the official sister school and that it must be an allgirls school that holy name is catholic or private is also irrelavant in the smcs article if a reader interested in information on holy name wants to learn about it heshe can go to the holy name wiki i believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about smcs and the same for st mike is info on the hnmcs wiki \xe2\x80\x94 preceding unsigned comment added by the point of including this basic information is to show how holy name of mary college school and st michael is college school are connected by virtue of their school type singlegender and religious affiliation the inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools these parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article they are two separate institutions if you want to write a paragraph describing the schools connections that can be done in subarticle within the main article readers can go to the other school is wiki for more detailed information and do not need to see it in the introduction where it appears as selfserving pr see basic navigation in wikipedia wikipedia articles are all linked or crossreferenced when highlighted text like this is seen it means there is a link to some relevant article or wikipedia page with further indepth information elsewhere holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead the reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attachedhttpenwikipediaorgwikiwikipediaabout so if understand correctly the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view i only ask mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools in removing that content mikeycanuck commented see view history removed superfluous information on holy name should be in hnm is wiki so mikeycanuck you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article i want to ensure we have reached agreement before i go ahead and add that paragraph the detailed information does not belong in the introduction which should always be concise and relevant in a later section a description of the school is links is acceptable if it is relevant if smcs chose holy name as its sister school for certain reasons and they are verifiable i would not object i am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse i never',0

about corticopia corticopia is past hello i just want to share with you some information you might consider important we had a very difficult time months ago removing mexico from central america in the article north america why because an anonimous user ip from toronto canada was reverting all the changes i finally discovered he was an already registered user and got him blocked because of sockpuppetry one month later i found out he was already been accused of sockpuppetry with that account well my point is that he is against of mexico being included in north america his main argument was that the un geosheme includes mexico in ca and that is it he also denies that north america is also a subregion of america and ignores the cited content proving him wrong well he is corticopia for months he was retired and trust me no body changed the articles north america and central america specially this one to say mexico was in ca suddenly a new user shows up he deleted a line in the article ca it said mexico is rarely yet sometimes included in central america under certain definitions this line was discussed and agreed he changed it to mexico is included in central america then to mexico is sometimes included in central america i do not know what his problem is the important thing is i totally felt this is the same person we had a very serious vandalism problems months ago so i checked his edit list wow what a discovery his first edit was the article issac asimov and articles about canada and some other regions of the world it was very obvious it was the same person please check this sources and this please read them carefully please check the contributions of each accused sockpuppetry account specially the one of userex post factoid it is very obvious he is the same person he was dragged into the article mexico when he was unable to win again in the article central america he did not even try to change the article north america because he knows a lot of people guard that article so his reason to say mexico is in southern north america are purely false and personal he wants to exclude mexico or make it look appart from canda and the usa i am telling you this because i think you do not realize his reasons are just personal a personal aversion against mexico being included in north america if he is so interested in accuracy of the articles why is not he editing the article usa he even asked supaman to do it by himself he is just there to exclude mexico please read carefully the evidence provided in each sockpuppetry case you said that you are an administrator in spanish wikipedia so i think you are experienced in these cases you will find it is the same person cortiopia has edited the same pattern of articles that the other accounts did too bad i warned him and i am sure he stopped editing with that account to prevent being identified i think we should stop him and prevent him from editing the article with his biased excluding information even if sourced because his reasons are just personal and not for the sake of accuracy let is talk',0

you have made a mistake i was pointing out that those described as black are underrepresented on this site it you go to the talk page of the big bill broonzy article you will read a post i left in january of where i mentioned this issue no one asked women if they wanted the vote it was the suffragettes who put the proposal on the table now that women in egypt have the vote does that mean we should disenfranchise them because the european suffragettes from one hundred years ago did not ask them if they wanted to be represented i was pointing out in the examples given above that representation is not served by those who are not of the group seeking representation and that representation itself is a form of dialogue that does not arrive fully formed airline pilots work in consultation with the civil aviation authority to improve and implement safety measures for air travel and this affects all who travel by air people what we have here is someone who read into my post what they wished to see written and not what was actually written i also highlighted at the broonzy talk page that this issue is a point of divergence between wikipedia editors i mentioned in the post above that this needs to be discussed here because we all of us here regardless of background genetics need to ask those who are being described as black if they wish to join this site to affect the consensus guideline anyway you boring me now with your lack of original ideas bring something of your own to the table rather than falling back on misreading and misinterpretation you are being facetious negative evasive and living up to your username of squeakbox if you insist on burying this issue on a guideline proposal page then the issue dies because we do not have enough blackie editors as it is and it will become just a minor discussion between a few wikipedia editors who probably are not of the group being described and discussed this article will have many african and west indian readers whereas the village pump rfc and other such pages will have very few look i really need to get back to writing articles for the database for the enterprise nx i have a lot of faith in nasa and the american people is desire to explore space so can we leave this discussion as is and accept that borg assimilation may not desirable but it is a highly practical way of overcoming racism lol',0

melanie phillips hi thanks for your message i reverted three attacks on her i think i muddled yours with another one prob the new statesman one hence my edit comment when reverting yours was inappropriate and i apologise for this regarding your the refs the first one says lovers of the unusual rejoice within days melanie phillips will make a public apology in july mad mel lifted and embellished a mistake from the neocon website harry is place regarding mohammad sawalha a palestinianborn british man whom al jazeera had mistranscribed referring to evil noxious jews at a rally this is a cheap and nasty throwaway remark it contains nothing of substance and in fact is a pure ad hominem attack so i am not sure that under blp guidelines it is appropriate at all the second one says indeed within much of the liberal commentariat she has long been dismissed as mad mel as someone who has lost her rational and moral compass here the writer is reporting unnamed thirdparty sources this hardly seems a good source for what in effect amounts to a grievous blp violation i have two other comments about the page would not it be much better to try and find sources which engage critically and rationally with her views instead of regurgitating the above types of nastiness there have been some quite vile instances of vandalism on the page recently and in addition there seems to be a general tendencytrend at the moment to denigrate her in some way almost as though it is the only way of editing the article as editors we should i suggest be careful not to be influenced by this and to steer well clear of ad hominemtype slurs and focus on her views instead best wishes',0

special task force hey there would you mind stepping in on the article special task force i am taking a more proactive role in the improvement of united nations related articles as well as planning to create a wikiproject dedicated to human rights and aids groups which means i do not want to get bogged down fighting over trivial things however i do not like the idea of referanced material that i have put into wikipedia being slowly eroded away thankyou sure i will take a look into it \xe2\x80\x94 as you might already have seen your edits were promptly reverted by another user so as to avoid rr i probably will open an arb on this not because that paragraph is particularly significant but because it is important to put such behavior as deleting referancedcited infomation and using various users in cabal to surplant wikipedia policy please inform me on my talk page if you would like to be included in such an arb case i completely understand if you do not as it is a long often infuriatingly long process i think this conflict worked out well the article got a whole new section \xe2\x80\x94',0

well now i see why i missed your comment the first timeit was not even on my talkpage i read it on someone else is talkpage broxton is and got confused haha but anyway yeah to give a good example of a cup of coffee mls transaction let me go back to toronto is actions in the expansion draft of in expansion drafts clubs have the option to protect a certain number of players while leaving others unprotected unprotected players can be drafted at will by the expansion franchise toronto in this example who can take one from each team one of the league is clubs real salt lake made a strategic gamble that they could leave one of their keytotemic players jason kreis now their manager unprotected they assumed that tfc would want nothing to do with an aging player whose oversized salary would be a big hit on their cap seeing an opportunity mo johnston at tfc took kreis from rsl in the draftnot because he actually wanted kreis but because he knew that rsl still needed him by doing this tfc was able to briefly hold kreis hostage until rsl agreed to trade something else of value to get kreis back so kreis was briefly a tfc player but only because he became a pawn in larger machinations because of instances like this which are common enough throughout league history we seem to have a consensus to disregard inandout situations during the offseason and for a bit of further detail \xe2\x80\x94 not relevant to atieno and usl players but important as a point of reference for many other usbased players \xe2\x80\x94 it should be noted that mls has a singleentity corporate structure and that technically all players are contracted by the league itself not by individual teams this means that all listings of player tenures with mls teams are de facto in the first place and that gives us a bit of leeway in striking out certain unimportant and very temporary tenures as in the example given hope that helps \xc2\xa0\xe3\x80\x8adefender of open editing\xe3\x80\x8,0
there is a discussion on what to call the article now',0
your make a good point let me first address it from the perspective of marshall hodgson civilization is a somewhat arbitrary term often narrowly defined by language this obviously has its limits on the other hand the more broadly you define a civilization the more subgroupings it must include eventually we come to see civilizations as groupings useful for the purpose at hand and ultimately civilizations like religions are selfdefined hodgson considers the lands of islam to constitute a world civilization he calls islam a world civilization in the title of his book the venture of islam conscience and history in a world civilization for another perspective i can turn to h patrick glenn in legal traditions of the world speaking on tradition and identity not all is arbitrary in the definition of a tradition or civilization glenn quotes fernand braudel who speaks of an underlying structure of civilization those elements of a civilization which could not be changed without a fundamental change or more probably disappearance of the tradition itself applying this criteria to islamic civilization one immediately understands that structure to be the religion of islam to summarize looking at the lands of islam with its concept of umma the shared traditions the shared arabic religious and often secular language and indeed the shared religion of islam it seems logical to fall in with those who perceive the outline of a world islamic civilization',0
fine i removed the disputed conjecture',0
bobolus is not the author of the text i am this text was a commissioned translation that the client presumably by bobolus on behalf of the subject of the article has indicated that does not wish to pay for on the basis of his or her belief that the final sentence he is married with five children suggested that the subject is married to five children i propose that the line in the article be changed to the correct english married with five children and if the poster indeed refuses to pay for the translation then i assert that this text is my intellectual property and therefore should be removed until an article without conflicts concerning intellectual property can be created',0

ok to be fair i could have more properly identified the photo in question as a promotional photograph an oversight which has been corrected however as to your allegation that there is no parallel between this photo and the one for the monkees article if my memory serves me corectly the monkees photo was actually included as album art on one of their records i think it may have been the birds the bees the monkees but i am not sure as far as your hurt feelings go it does not matter if you are an editor hell it do not matter if you are the damn founder of wikipedia itself to just go in and start making major changes to articles which you have had no part in authoring without any advance discussion is just plain rude and yes i call that vandalism your attitude of selfrighteousness is an excellent example of why many people are abandoning wikipedia as it appears to be turning into an elite universe populated solely by those who who have no life outside of their computer monitor',0
introductionsecond paragraph the source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written the article makes legal distinction between cfs bc and cfs national it does not support a broad assertion that as you say the cfs generally referred to legally consists of separate organizations the national cfs a provincial chapter and cfsservices which are often collectively referred to as cfs also the organizations generally brand themselves as cfs and do not make the distinction between the branches your source does not support that statement also brand is a corporate term and not npov language also in addition it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the cfs defacto one organization is not supported by the one source you provided see the reliable sources policy sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made wprely simon fraser is the peak has a well established and long time editorial bias against cfs so i am not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source again check wprely for all the details this also seems to be directly related to the defederation issues in bc the article you use as evidence seems to speak more to what went on in bc last winter',0
idiocy i made a number of changes clearly described in edit summaries which vastly improved this article now a series of utter morons have taken it upon themselves to revert my work for no reason whatsoever i would ask them to explain themselves here but they have no possible explanation for what they are doing so i just put this here to note how some people of appallingly limited intellectual ability are here not to build an encyclopaedia but simply to play some kind of bizarre game pretty hilarious that one of these sick idiots says to discuss things on talk while going around removing everything i post on talk pages seriously what a fucking child pathetic',1

march utc yes that is the spirit of the section the respective articles of all of the entrants so far have indicated that they were in some way affected by polio since people generally do not even know that they have had the mild form of the illness most people who know they did have polio probably had some degree of paralysis imo the criteria for inclusion should be have a wikipedia biography this is absolutely required it must state in their wikipedia bio that the person had polio again if they know that they had it it was likely a more serious form or the polio status can be sourced from somewhere else these criteria seem to be similar other lists of notable survivors',0

reference over the last edits on the article or more i assume you would intense the gravity of his actions here he is simply soo bent on for just the removal of this particular line basically etymology deals with various perspectives of a word and their history it is absurd to quote that maldives could have only been derived from sanskrit the literal english translation for maladvipa is garland of flowers and the tamilmalaithivu and malayalammaladwipu terms used here too mean garland of flowers this is the statement contained in the article before usersrisuren interfered with his pov discretely removing this content but retaining only the sinhala translation usersrisuren keeps talking on trash about the old source and persistently attacking me with nonsensical accusations about my editing but is totally evasive on how this particular textand with the source which provides the accurate tamil translation is supposedly wpor or problematic instead he simply rambles on accusing me of disruptive editing vs etc without explaining what exactly is in the text that needs to be modified i have gone through his behavior in this talk page as well elsewhere and i can see he has grossly abused these discussions absolutely necessitating the need for administrative action on his behavior for disgracefully violating the tpgs almost all his editswhich have been consistently poised against the tamil people in general need to be reviewed and he needs to explain on what overall value he has added to wikipedia in his edits except for addingremoving sensitive information that fulfills his whims so perhaps involvement of more editors to the issue will see through his lowdown motives with which he edits and the barbaric means he resorts to when he gets desperate so i guess we let him do his course of job as there is sadly not much room to deal with his uncivil and inflammatory behavior talk contr mail',0

citations and external link i checked all the links and they work which is good conversely the chronicles definitely should not be listed as an external link there are many other relevant links regarding the round table a forum posting should not be used as something reliable also we should continue to discuss the state of the contributing attendees i checked some of the names and they had third party sources should they be added again since all wikipedia needs is third party sources thanks for the check i disagree about deleting the chronicle website link the the article establishes that that discussion is notable yes it is anonymous but it is a discussion board for active academics a truck driver would not be able to construct a useful post for that thread and anonymity has virtues as well as vices anonymity makes it possible to say what you really think without fear of reprisal though at the risk that people will spread misinformation without fear of getting caught many of the posters in that chronicle thread have track records in other threads that make what they say more reliable than it would otherwise bekind of like wikipedia as for the contributing attendees i am skeptical that we can create something that is not listcruft but it would be a lot easier to evaluate if you proposed a specific edit with genuine thirdparty sources the che is not being used as a source external links are different from sources well my problem with the chronicle for higher learning is that it seems to be very odd to me for some reason i just have read the external link requirement page and the chronicle for higher learning breaks several of the rules please read wpel under link to be avoided and the chronicle forumdiscussionblog breaks all of a good amount of rules i was drawn to the external links because when i was attempting to fine info regarding the table many other links that could not be cited in the article because of wiki guidelines seem like they are much more revelant than the chronicle blog for external links i propose adding another link and removing the chronicle link because it does not adhere to wiki guidelines academic your statement regarding who posts to the board can neither be confirmed or denyed because the postings are anonymous and nothing can be proven it could be truck drivers with no idea about what they are talking about or otherwise that is why wiki discourages forums as reliable external links more discussion needed but i am going to suggest the chronicle be removed it is already referred to under the the explanation and does not need to be listed as an external link i read wpel and i do not see that it breaks any rules what rules are you claiming it breaks you really need a stronger argument than it seems to be very odd to me for some reason the december the story has already validated the chronicle link it is a bit rich to start invoking rules here when you have conspicuously failed to do so in response to repeated requests above in any event as you yourself have pointed out here there is a distinction to make between policies and guidelines i disagree that the times article justifies the link to a blog it can be argued that it justifies a link to the chronicles for higher education website but not to a blog that god knows who started academic you claim that my only argument is it seems odd however this is not true if you read carefully the wpel under the section links to be avoided you would have your answer as to why the link to the chronicle blog is not up to the guidelines at all nomoskedasticity i am not attempting to use rules only when it seems fit you and academic are asking me to point out regulations in the posts above and yet now you are stating that even though the chronicle blog link breaks wiki guidelines i should be okay with it because i was having a discussion about other rules above no that will not work for this page i will discuss things with the other editors on this page but i will not be bullied into not asking',0

suspected why does not he prove it there are logs history here please check the ip user page and check what kinu deleted also check that kinu banned me because he felt attacked not a particularly good person to be the judge even more and so we do not fall on the same discussion do not continue with the discussion about the ownership of the talk page it does not matter my opinion about that now because i was already banned for that and i fullfilled that ban i was now banned because i readded two lines that kinu had deleted to a user page those lines were not particularly offensive then kinu added that i created an account come on that was what everyone was asking for btw he added that account to a deletion page but you can check it too from the ip mentioned so i am banned months not because of the discussion about the ownership of user pages i was already banned for that but for undeleting something that kinu deleted without giving reasons note that we are not discussing the veracity of those statements unless you think people should be banned for asking later kinu added that i created a troll or something like that account how i did not have an account so how i used it to add the sentences mentioned if your policy is do not delete unless offensive then why was it deleted furthermore if you check the discussions you will see that they where kept on my user page finally kinu added that i was abusing the unblock template well what could i do kinu baned me and so went any posibility to appeal most admins do not read user pages unless you add that template of course i will accept that final ban agreed with wp policies but i had no other choice and it was a cheap way for kinu to silence me i do not think i should be banned for this because kinu clearly showed being arbitrary but if you think this later ban should stay then think if it should stay for months i am sure someone will say that this is a sockpuppet account i have no problems to continue this discussion on my initial userpage and having this one deleted but i need to be able to edit it i ask any reviewer any admins or users to check my changes after my last ban and see for yourselves if what i am saying is right or not',0

scullard quote is misleading the quote used in the illness section of the article from howard hayes scullard emerged from his sickness cruelty is misleading as it implies that the historian in question supported this view however the actual phrase from the book from the gracchi to nero is emerged according to tradition a monster of lust and diabolical cruelty scullard does not support this view himself he is merely remarking that roman historians tended to take this view a view that most modern historians have moderated to a great extent i suggest that the quote is removed or changed to a more accurate modern reflection of the view with another quote from scullard the balance of his mind was to some degree upset which is quite different from the description of a monster',0

so ccbysa content can not be included in anything licensed under the gfdl and gfdl content can not be included in anything licensed under ccbysa including wikipedia i had been assuming that since wikipedia was previously under gfdl and switched to ccbysa the latter was backwardcompatible with the former apparently that was not the case but rather some kind of special temporary exemption was created\xe2\x80\x94i am not at all clear on how that would be possible but then i am not a lawyer in fact i now see under my edit box that it says you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the ccbysa license and the gfdl emphasis added i am not even sure what kind of exemption could even in principle make it possible to license content under two mutually exclusive licenses simultaneously in any case i doubt that the hydrogenaudio folks would be interested in suing the wikimedia foundation but apparently if they wanted wikipedia to be able to reuse their content they would have to change their license since they are a wiki too though i am not sure how they could do that lacking whatever special mojo wikipedia used in lucky for me i do not care enough to waste any more time on this but i kind of wish someone would fix it',0

wpfilm coordinator hey i saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for wpfilm concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more i am a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities is it largely updating reviewing articles and aiding in the establishment of task forces at least as far as i can see do coordinators generally specialize in various areas ie one handles task forces others reviewing or a combination of any such duties if so i was wondering whether i could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists i rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all wikipedians and i have a very good grasp of what is required for fl status if i was elected i probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under wpfilm is scope and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to fl status with a coordinated effort that said i understand that i am relatively new to the film project and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project just curious as to your thoughts on the matter cheers converse',0

ditto on gan to me the article is ready though i still intend to make some minor edits on another front i think we ought to leave the dating issue where it stands even though i disagree with heylin is assessment of midjuly which he guesses at based on the fact that bob made its debut on the charts on july see shades p i find that ridiculous for example biabh took six weeks from its official release on march to reach the charts may highway got out much quicker with a onemonth lapse from its august release before charting going back earlier another side took about six weeks to chart and freewheelin more about than three months using midjuly then means giving bob two weeks to debut which is absurd of course the whole problem centers on what is meant by release in this case it is being used to mean distribution which was obviously delayed in bob is case however the billboard advertisement of june gives at least three other clues to that pressing packaging and promotion with those three in place distribution could not have been more than a week behind if not already in motion',0
whathow are the ones from willking is talk page vandalism i was asking him to give a reason plz reply travis',0
support if only the intro of the articlelist is explicit enough in defining just what it is that it is listingranking then there should be no real controversy btw there is already a list of countries and other lists that overlap also republika srpska and other former breakaway states have renounced their claim to sovereignty as part of a peace deal',0

i guess jfd is trying to discourage you to get in touch with me via email since he fears some kind of academical threat just to clear some things up i was not the guy who went india did not exist until i would never post something as blunt offensive and ignorant as that however yes i have changed a few things around as a correction it is not to offend anyone but like kenneth tennyson and his devoted sidekick jfd the green hornet and kato i too have some historical points of views i understand that you have been accused of being a panindian nationalist while i have been accused of being a tamil nationalist as far as indian martial arts are concerned martial arts from both your culture and mine are in the indian martial arts section therefore it effects both of us it seems like through this wikiconflict it has thrown us together into one pot if i am here to put you or your culture down or to discredit india why in the first place would i have stuck up for you i had not intentions in mind when i did that it just ticked me off when kenneth sent you that messed up message just like for example a few years ago when a punjabi store owner was beaten up in a hate crime i was outraged i see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of northern inda while i have the same for southern india likewise you are very knowledgeable about ancient bharat and its mahajanapada republics while i have the same for ancient tamilakkam since this page on indian martial arts effects us both maybe together we can combine both our knowledge to present a remarkable page yes i do understand our passions which may sometimes clash however if we could set aside some of that and work together in a givetake mentality we can make things work at the same time we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what jfdkenny think but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on indian martial arts do you agree with me on this if so it would be nice if we could communicate via email i have more ideas to share with you i believe we can make this work as far as jfd is concerned i do not know what his intentions are maybe he feels a little threatened of the possiblity of you and me teaming up on this project or maybe i am wrong indrancroos',0
my worry is the number of editors who would scrutinise your every movement on wikisource you do not have as much history so there are less people watching you it would be a much more pressured environment for you can you remain calm in these circumstances my perspective on wikipedia is much different now i have enjoyed immensely wikisource where granted the atmosphere is much friendlier and encouraging so my editing energies can safely go there i have made close to edits there with no problems and certainly no attacks or negative feedback from editors i do not intend to get involved in the award culture on wikipedia such fac far or other areas where editors are competitively vested in collecting awards my first interest is fixing up articles that i would like to link to wikisource articles but are in such bad condition that i do not link secondly i would create articles that are needed for explanations for wikisource articles i will stay away from any article that belongs to a vested editor where an editor lists and article under articles i wrote or refers to my articles in posts i will make it a practice to check histories for that kind of editor outside the facfar arena there is not much of a problem i do not think if any at all i have created over articles in a multitude of subjects mostly to fill in missing links on wikipedia i will continue with low key endeavors such as that however at the sign of any push back i will simply not continue editing the article or dealing with that editor or even editing wikipedia for a while also my misery was generated by a small group of editors i am hoping they will be proscribed from harassing me in an arcom settlement \xe2\x80\x94 talk there are certain people i intend to avoid at all costs i hope they will do me the great favor of avoiding me as well who are these other people unless you name names how can they know to avoid you what if they choose not to avoid you how will you react then fatuorum as a followup to malleus is question i did not ask for or to follow me to venezuela articles nor did bishonen ask for at least two accounts to follow her so how will staying away from fac and far help certain people avoid you talk',0

paris rer ehm some comments about your gare a\xc3\xa9roport charles de gaulle rer edits it is not a good idea to create a new article when there is already an article about the same subject the naming convention for rer stations is x paris rer except when the station is also used by regular trains transilien ter or other then we use gare de x i just saw that you moved nearly all of the rer stations better discuss it before you introduce a new standard name if you are sure that no trains from charles de gaulle take the branch line to robinson you can change the type field into b instead of both but i checked it on the ratp website and they do i do not think it is very useful to show all the different options for the rer lines some trains skip a few stations or serve only part of the line i think for the b line alone there are more than variants talk',0

to claim that what is not relevant i agree with the suggestion of including some criticism of the term as i have said repeatedly the passage from gardner does not criticize the term nonaristotelian logic it addresses a different use of the word nonaristotelian this by itself seems like sufficient reason to remove it furthermore its current use in the article blurs the line between the two senses of nulla far from educating readers it would confuse them unnecessarily even if you want to address korzybski is word choice in the article adding this passage with no explanation seems to me like a terrible way to do it',0

talknonsense please stop your disruptive editing if you continue to violate wikipedia is no original research policy by adding your personal analysis or synthesis into articles as you did at lane splitting you may be blocked from editing dennis bratland talk where do you get this stuff it is not original research to say that in the united states unless something is prohibited by statute then it is legal this is a basic premise of the american legal system california is part of the united states ergo in california as well as the rest of the us if there is no statute prohibiting lane splitting then it is legal find me a statute that prohibits it and i will shut up but since the california highway patrol and the california dmv both say that lanesplitting is legal then mr hoy is claim that it is a grey area is nonsense and now i will go back and delete that untruthful crap once again if you want a war then fine you can have one but you are in the wrong the california dmv and chp aren not personal analysis if they say lanesplitting is distinctly legal then we can assume that the state of california is correct while mr hoy is full of bovine excrement you are in the wrong very very wrong',0

dear readers i have been forced to make some editorial changes due to the attack on my reputation it is my personal opinion that the previous article is a smear job and attempts to slander my good name a few points moving from toronto to bc was for one sole reason and that was to find work there is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge thus it is not right to say so i ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge furtermore while it is wholly true i have emailed the cpc and former ycl members but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby as a former communist i am concerned about any attempt to rebuild that movement furthermore i am not a member of the prolife board anymore and have not worked for campaign life since i still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion and that is my right it has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays i in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such finally this question about pictures the manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all i do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on mannings part please prove otherwise once last thing re the mulroney dinner i was not dressed as chef that was john clarke not me i simply walked into the room and towards the podium i did not nor was i ever in the kitchen at any time i suggest you check the archives of the toronto star and toronto sun in addition i am seeking a legal judgement against the prochoice action network for their slanderous article and i would ask politely that you not link to it i am making every effort here to be accomodating and would ask the same please of wiklepdia thank you merle',0

you are curious eh well i am not so adverse either being curious about the nature of certain edit patterns but in the regards to the matter more immediately at hand the referenced ipcc document summary for policymakers is frankly not a very wellwritten summary for its intended um not so aware audience it makes all sorts of refs to particular time periods like the reference period and but in terms of projection it does very clearly single out as in the graph spm on page and especially in this highlighted summary box on page projections of future changes in climate a major advance of this assessment of climate change projections compared with the tar is the large number of simulations available from a broader range of models taken together with additional information from observations these provide a quantitative basis for estimating likelihoods for many aspects of future climate change model simulations cover a range of possible futures including idealised emission or concentration assumptions these include sres illustrative marker scenarios for the \xe2\x80\x93 period and model experiments with greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations held constant after year or by the way you never answered my last question about moving solar variation bc aka',0

although alexa brown meets the minimum requirements for a separate article i believe that wpn is lead is relevant here editors may use their discretion to merge or group two or more related topics into a single article is highly relevant creating separate pages for these tightly related subjects both causes editorial hassles trying to keep the two pages in sync and needing to decide whether a piece of information belongs on one page or the other and reduces the likelihood that a reader will get the whole story because most people will only read one of them also keeping it all here may reduce the temptation to use the biography for selfpromotion of the politically active parents andor their organization imo mergingnot splitting is the better answer',0

grouping khoikhoi has been adding this tabthe turks of turkey can be broken down into a variety of segments and the majority of selfidentifying turks include four main groupings rumelian turks who are mostly of balkan origin anatolian turks who compose the bulk of ethnic turks found in anatolia see history section central asian turks who remain a large segment of the population that has been moving to turkey for centuries and eurasian turks from russia and the caucasus such as the tatars and azerbaijanis who have more recent ties with turkic peoples these turks share similar languages and cultures which is not true because according to it the large segment of the population should be from central asia but its not true they should be included in the anatolian turks because noone in turkey has recent ties with central asia other than tatarsetc which are already explained below as eurasian turks so it makes groupings',0

australian federal election i thought you might like to know that the pendulum you added has had removal attempted you may wish to contribute to talkpage discussion jackie trad errr well it might be kind of skating close to original research use of unreliable social media etc but she mentioned it was her birthday on april twice on twitter and the courier mail said she was on april so i kind of worked it out from that i will remove it if you are not comfortable with it i am happy to wait for a firm independent source such as a parliamentary bio wow you have done all the federal byelections love your work i honestly never thought australian politics on wikipedia would develop to what it is today it is now done federally i wonder if wikipedia will ever reach the point of having an article for every state election every state byelection and every state mp a barnstar for you the original barnstar for your work on australian politicians melbourne state byelection and australian christians i do not suppose you would like to do the honours i will try to get something of value on these guys together this weekend i remember having an attempt back when they were first registered with the aec but i had a lot of difficulty working out exactly what their relationship with the cdp was they seem to be what used to be the victorian branch of the cdp with possibly several others still affiliated with them somehow hopefully there is some more info around now especially with this byelection in the works i had a look at the byelection page and fixed up the candidates table a little it was listing candidates of the democrats secular party and sep none of which are registered in victoria i have noticed though that antony has started listing unregistered parties in much the same way as registered ones so this will be worth keeping an eye on in the future thanks colours and images in member list pages what is the logic behind adding these looks like a lot of work for something that well hurts my eyes talkback sutherland shire careful you are reverting vandalism back into the article presumably unintentional note yes i was mistakenly division of boothby a why put the parentheses around sir b with john mcleay sr and john mcleay jr it was clear they were two different people and clear they were related with your changes this is no longer clear your thoughts cheers hi after a brief note at wtaup where i hardly ever get responses any more so i did not wait that long i have been implementing these sirs in the member lists with regards to boothby i am glad you brought that up it was one of the only ones i trouble with if you would prefer',0

baroque guitars are not tenstring guitars andrew frankly you are mistaken it is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a tenstring guitar no one refers to the baroque lute as the string lute but correctly as the course lute this is a wellestablished musicologicalorganological convention string guitar is the only exception to this and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular culture in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses if two strings function as one string they are a course not two separate strings in contrast a tenstringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted this is not the case on the baroque guitar which effectively only has five courses moreover the term tenstring guitar has come to signify a particular instrument which is not a baroque guitar you are evidently not a musicologistorganologistsemiologistsemantician so i do not see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue which relates to organology and semantics',0

hey kpjas as i remember i regularly got back to your warnings with mostly appologetic notes with english being my second language it is not so easy for me to adress all your options for a complain or explanation of the dispute sometimes it takes time to formulate the right sentence with the right words to complain or go into further discussions and explanations and i might not always have enough time for doing all that i would rather not complain or go with short notes than to write something that would sound funny and vague also i would ask you to pay more attention to what i say in my edits and discussions because the behavior i present in it is much better that the behavior that ivan stambuk or any of his group does at least i go with facts and arguments which they never have sorry but in an extent of my ability i will not allow the croatian nationalistic pov to infiltrate on wikipedia they can have theirown isolated croatian wikipedia which is mostly based on lies and misinterpretations of the facts but wherever i see a misleading information regarding any linguistic or other well known fact which is poisoned by this cronationalistic group i will react and try to correct the facts please try to concentrate more on what i point out in my discussions and see what demages and nonaccepable changes they have done to the templates maps and even some of the texts concerning serbocroatian language shtokavian dialect south slavic languages etc it has to stop they have been stopped many times before and with appropriate intervetions they will be stopped again because it is ruining wikipedia as a reliable source of informations regards my best regards to you hexagon as well thanks',0

thank you for your reply your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me perhaps users such as blixx are good friends of yours given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them i find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing all because i complained about my treatment lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen you just do not like it when i diagree with a point of view are you following the orders of blixx and co yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me they have called me a nasty piece of work an islamist haddad is puppet etc have you even warned them i think not so its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when i criticise blixx and co i get punished one rule for one and one rule for another eh thank you for explaining what the word contraversial means to me maybe you can explain the meaning of another word for me hypocrite i want to end by apologising for any offence caused but you have to understand my frustation at being treated this way',0
the trouble with mahler analysis is that there is not a consensus about his compositional thinking so like it or not comments are going to be subjective and may well look like original research but it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony he deliberately withheld a number from it because he had a superstition about ninth symphonies being terminal the work we know as his ninth was in fact his tenth and like das lied von der erde posthumously premiered this article does not address that it has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four movements jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale one also quotes the eighth symphony is second movement it might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria two of each separated by a funeral march based on elements of the trinklied which begins the work in the role of a development section and sonata the last section of the finale with its repeated ewig could also be seen both as a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception so the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed but we still have something which can be called a symphony even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor the eighth could be imagined i am not proposing this as an addition to the article simply suggesting that it would not be too hard to find similar thinking in the literature croy',0
hi arejay i think the edit by kaysov was to list the names of states and languages in an alphabetical order and thereby not giving any biased preferences to any states or languages to be listed first eg tamil nadu that is first on the list of states in the article would be last because andhra pradesh begins with a and tamil nadu with t if that is the purpose then i think we need to stick to it sep utc',0

lol on the play one on wikipedia comment an office under the united states is afaik any government office federal state or local i would imagine that just as it would be a breach of separation of powers for someone to be simultaneously congressman and president it would be a breach of federalism for someone to simultaneously serve in two different governments i have no idea why the seniority date is not the actual date of oathtaking but he could not have voted on federal legislation until he resigned as a city councilman and was sworn into congress so there was in reality no dual officeholding',0

thanks for the suggestion re friends episodes articles i used the capitals used in the main list of friends episodes page where prior editors capitalized all the first letters of the titles i totally agree with your point though i will take some time to format these correctly as well as for the debate about having an article for each episode i have looked for episode summaries for friends before and they are not very in depth what i was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular summary format as another example considering the legacy of star trek and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the net i think the wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job i am even using the little nav table i am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate what is already available out there',0

i would but i dont know how third estate national assembly re the tennis court oath serment du jeu de paume was a pledge signed by members of france is third estate on june this was an important factor in the coming of the french revolution the members swore that they would not disband until louis xvi had granted a constitution for the people of france aaaaaaaaaah why are you changing it im not sure but i think the oath was written by abbe sieyes slight change changed the wording from leave to disband saying that they would not leave until they had written a constitution gives the impression that it was written all in one night this is not true to took along to write a constrictions for france also and interesting fact the tennis court is speculated to having been in actuality a handball court adding dates and sources so far so good but you have no dates and no sources if there are no objections i will add dates using information from a history of western society sixth edition by mckay hill and buckler if someone could please put that in bibliography format im missing the first hundred pages in my book totally vandalized and requires a rewrite well obviously this article over the past few days has been totally vandalized and stripped of its information somebody tried to rewrite the entire and what used to be complex and informative article quickly as nobody seems to have a saved copy of the article in need of some wiki admins hello mehicdino i am not sure whether you are talk \xe2\x80\xa2 contribs who edited the article to remove immatureincorrect text however can either one of you be more specific with what is inaccurate there was some vandalism in the previous weeks which i had reverted already all revisions of the page are stored automatically and you can access them by clicking on the history tab above and clicking on the date and time of the revision most everything in the article looks correct granted i am not an expert on this subject but given that the revision only removed minimal details which seem correct and also removed many of the wikilinks i have gone ahead and reverted back to the previous version for now can you clarify on what is incorrect thanks a note vandalism should never require a rewrite as it is very easy to revert to a previous version no i am not the ip you state i could be because it does not match mine i was just saying a few days ago somebody actually put much effort into vandalizing this article to a pile of rubbish thanks for the reply i am just making sure that there is nothing that is obviously inaccurate presently i hope i took care of all the vandalism with the revert thanks a note this still needs rewriting what is this the tennis coart started in the late is and ended in the early is it resulted in the parilization of the queen of scottland it occured in witchitah maine please correct the vandalism has already been removed thanks for letting us know a note picture i found a better picture at this link httpwwwloynoeduseduffytenniscourtoathjpg \xe2\x80\x94the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk \xe2\x80\xa2 contribs i am going to refrain from uploading that picture for now i believe if my recollection is correct that the current image is a copy of the actual sketch and that the colored version was done later by anothe',0

documenatation please with respect to the following paragraph you repeatedly removed certain materials with the comment i want documentation of those claims if you please i have now consulted the great terror a reassessement a standard reference work and after a little searching found passages which support the generally accepted information which you deleted see the great purge is the name given to the events of the late s in the soviet union when millions of people were arrested about one million executed and an estimated million to sent to labour camps according to on the personality cult and its consequencesnikita khrushchev a significant part of the accusations were based on forced confessions and on loose interpretations of vague articles of article rsfsr penal code which dealt with counterrevolutionary crimes due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by nkvd troikas the purge targeted all categories of the society members of the communist party of the soviet unioncommunist party the government the armed forces and the intelligentsia as well as antisoviet elements among peasants kulaks in industry and in transport the height of the purge occurred while the soviet secret police the nkvd was headed by nikolai yezhov from september to august this period is often referred to as the yezhovschina yezhov storm however the purge was carried out on the orders of stalin himself it is rather obvious that you do not have a copy of this standard reference work available or choose not to refer to it furthermore you seem to be unfamiliar with generally accepted knowledge with respect to this area i believe it is a reasonable expectation that you familiarize yourself with the subjects you chose to edit on and be able to consult standard reference works and understand them could you please remedy this situation as it stands now you are wasting everyone is time asking that generally accepted information be extensively documented while simulaneously espousing information and positions that can only be referenced through fringe sources oct utc',0

i did not set that the proportion justifies any killing i am just interested in accentuate that for the whole ww ii and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is nazi germany there was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control to clarify even years after war the government and country organization was very limited many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge when you take for consideration that every one of fifth polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether now i hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations with accusation you must be very specific i understand and accepted the consideration about what happen but be specific be very specific and do not forget that first thing must be put first the story is regarding nations rather then individuals in this case you judge polish people etc versus german people one can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity however imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation he was attacked bitten almost killed he lost his eye and arm and now his neighbor says the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal the guy says but i was attacked and i lost his arm and my eye never mine the neighbor says this is a crime to hit somebody i know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject b arrogantly forgetting about the subject a simplifying you can not separate result from cause this why i protest intentional or not the action can be considered as magnification a part of object which is indivisible as',0

speedy deletion of lesh a tag has been placed on lesh requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia this has been done under section g of the criteria for speedy deletion because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company product group service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the wikipediabusiness faq for more information if you think that this notice was placed here in error you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself but do not hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with wikipedia is policies and guidelines talkcontribs',0

hi aoystreck thanks for contributing to helping make this article better spelling and grammar notably though and apostrophe is i spell checked the entire article and i think that i corrected all the spelling mistakes and the apostrophes spoliers i am undecided on what to do for this problem i do agree that saying to much about scenes being filmed is a give away but i think that occasionally mentioning what type of a scene is being filmed should be noted for example mentioning when and where they filmed scene is with what cast members and occasionally mention a notable setup or notable scene being filmed plot summary i am not sure if you cited this as a problem but think that the plot section has a reasonable amount of information and plot points throughout the development and writing section because both cast and crew released this information to the public domain via interviews statements etc so i think that it should be mention because if the information was not suppose to be known then they would not have stated it you also said that these three problems are among others if you could could you please cite other problems with this page so that i could fix them',0

october utc more on consensus the following about consensus followed slrubinsteins wikipolicy essay i pretty much agree with all that but it seems incomplete there are other important policies and guidelines for example there is wpconsensus and wpsummary style and wpundue weight to name a few just because some inserted material satisfies wpnpov wpv wprs and wpnor does not mean that an editor can insist repeatedly on inserting it into an article and whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus ferrylodge i certainly accept that other policies may apply and i know you are acting in good faith with good intentions but with all due respect i think your message muddies the waters first of all undue weight is a subsection of npov by my linking npov i simultaneously included undue weight the difference is i made it clear that npov is the umbrella policy and undue weight is just a component of that policy and has to be interpreted in the context of the policy as a whole you took it out of context which could mislead some people also summary style is not a policy i was talking primarily about policies summary style is a guideline and it may be useful to editors but it does not have the force of a policy finally i agree with you about consensus but the consensus policy addresses a different issue than i was raising my point was about what can go into articles consensus says nothing about what can or cannot go into articles the consensus policy is about interpersonal behavior and process the consensus policy is not about content npov v and nor are about content it is npov v and nor that determine what is acceptable and unacceptable content the consensus policy lays out a process for resolving conflicts over content but it does not establish principles for resolving the conflict the principles remain npov v and nor when editors get into a conflict we should consult wpconsensus for ideas about how we can better work together but before consensusbased editing the first step to working together is agreeing to abide by the content policies npov nor and v talk i agree that whether the material satisfies those policies should be determined not just by an individual editor but by consensus but consensus does not mean unanimity according to the policy it is a process of collaboration and to participate in this process everyone has to agree that if content is a notable significant and verifiable view from a reliable source it will go in even if i do not like it if they cannot say this and mean it they are not participating in a consensus process and some people above have argued that content should not go in even if it is notable verifiable and from a reliable source those people are not participating in a consensusbuilding process talk',0

too technical comment the maintenance template too technical has been removed i consider large swathes of the article are too technical and incomprehensible for instance what on earth do these statements mean tensed sentences which can neither be translated into synonymous tenseless sentences nor be given tenseless tokenreflexive truth conditions correspond if true to tensed facts the experience of temporal becoming like our experience of the external world is properly regarded as veridical in the absence of objective distinctions between past present and future the relations ordering events on the tenseless theory are only gratuitously regarded as genuinely temporal relations of earlierlater than the claim that temporal becoming is minddependent is selfdefeating since the subjective illusion of becoming involves itself an objective becoming in the contents of consciousness time as it plays a role in physics is a pale abstraction of a richer metaphysical reality omitting indexical elements such as the here and the now in the interest of universalizing the formulations of natural laws can anyone make the article more readable and comprehensible or are we all pretending that it makes perfect sense because we are afraid to look unintelligent for not understanding it',0

comment shabak is certainly the more prominent term in israel ie in hebrew i can confidently say that most people today do not know what you mean if you say shin bet however in english it is true that the prominent name has remained shin bet for who knows what reason it is still a hebrew name and for all intents and purposes the wrong one until that term is phased out and western media begins using the correct name shabak i guess wikipedia policy calls for us to continue using the current wrong term',0

wow you are hopeless lets start with the trifles you spelled necessarily wrong that does not give you much credibility the answer to your first question is no whites from liverpool speak scouse and they do not speak the same as whites from south london of course but i do not see what that has to do with white south african english however the answer to your second question is mostly yes most blacks from boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from new orleans most blacks from both areas speak what is called african american vernacular english of you are into political correctness which you seem to be which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in america i am not exactly sure what you mean by mother tongue english speakers do you mean l varieties i do not think my final statement is a violation of wpown because i never said i own this article nor did i ever think that i simply temporarily took it over if you will to make it a better description of white south african english those just happened to be the words i decided to use it says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject and while i am no expert i certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen with the notable exception of jacklumber i think you knew what i meant by that expression but it is certainly possible that you did not finally i will respond to your earlier comment that white south african english as a title for this article is simply racist you really have not explained to me how that would be a racist title i am going to assume that you meant either that title would suggest that only whites in south africa speak english and absolutely no one else does that title would suggest that whites are the most important group in south africa they are are better than everyone else and they are thus the only group in south africa deserving an article on the type of english they speak both of these choices seem rather absurd to me if you thought then i already proposed a solution for that we could give each indian south african english black south african english and white south african english its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of english spoken in south africa besides wsafe if you thought then you are racist let me explain for that title to be racist i would have to be white if i were a racist white person i would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better since we are both anonymous however there is no way you could possibly know my race you would have to rely on conjecture in this case your guess was that i was white after all if i were black and i proposed that i would have to somehow be racist against myself what i do not understand for sure is why you assumed i was white that is quite a racist assumption anyone in the world can edit wikipedia people from all races yet you assumed i was white unless you had statistics to back that assumption up which you did not then that is simply racist even if you did have statistics to back it up it still could be racist to me what you are saying is that only white people edit wikipedia and that people of other races are not intelligent enough of course i do not for sure but that is my conjecture',0

you are asking for secondary and tertiary sources explaining why these primary sources are encyclopedic i am not going to entertain you on this because you already demonstrated ill will by demanding sources and subsequently claiming these sources are somehow a coyright violation you are engaged in a stupid game not in improving wikipedia the importance of the quotes by doris day the most popular screen and stage presence throughout much of the th century and harry s truman twoterm us president do not require an explanation of relevance or encyclopedicity if you had sincerely sought such then you would have surely question why the paragraph on some use of a purple cow to sell ice cream s at all relevant and then if it is why it matters colin powell and queen beatrix got this sort of ice cream for free you are arguing from a standpoint of absolute weakness now go away',0

wikipedium hey tom although i agree with your criticisms of wikipedia i think it would be unfortunate if you abandoned it to start yet another fork project as a longtime editor of wikipedia i would like to stress that the key to not going crazy here is patience and thick skin instead of trying to reinvent wikipedia i would encourage you to try changing wikipedia one small step at a time it is not easy but the results can be very significant i have had policy and project ideas shot down but i have also had a small handful that have been successful and hopefully those small successes have made wikipedia a better place by the way if you really are sick of wikipedia you may want to take a look at veropedia it is not perfect but it has some good points and most of the editors and admins are wikipedia alum anyway good luck with whatever you decide to do',0

did you ever think that the reason people do not bother responding is that they have simply given up you do realize that most people do not want to contribute just so that they can fight useless internet battles with site administrators do not you the general consensus is why bother when only a handful of editors ever get to contribute because they have the right friends or know how to game the system what do you think is going to happen when nobody cares enough to bother contributing content to wikipedia the impression is fast becoming that the site is run by a handful of elitists who is policy is more important then the content or the people they serve your attitude is proof of that',0
a reason for celibacy i was reading this article and i noticed that one possible reason for celibacy is missing it is the reason i have chosen to become a celibate i have a mental disorder that many people are trying to cure i will not mention which one because it is not relevant in this context and i have become a celibate so that i cannot have children and therefore cannot contribute to the continuation of this mental disorder is gene what i am saying is do enough people become celibates for the reason that they cannot reproduce and therefore not give their unborn children undesirable genetic qualities like defects mental disorders ect if so would this be worth putting on this article',0

if you insert that content again you will be blocked mr darcy talk one solid example of why that content can not stay your edit said the story was unsubstantiated with no presentation made of either tangible proof or any named sources yet the reference you provided to back that up is an article by glazer himself that says several sources have told fox sports that favre earlier this year phoned the detroit lions prior to their battle versus favre is old team the green bay packers and gave them a rundown of the nuances of what green bay does on offense according to the sources favre actually spent over an hour on the phone with lions coaches who were connected with favre by thenteam president matt millen that story is not unsubstantiated and the use of anonymous sources is completely normal and accepted in journalism calling the story unsubstantiated is a violation of wpblp and implying that it was incorrect because of the lack of named sources is an arbitrary standard that violates wpnpov in addition in the third source you provide favre admits that he did have a conversation with the detroit executive and that favre said former players and coaches exchange information all the time that does not disprove anything glazer said and in some ways seems to support it as i said above if you reinsert that content i will have to block you from editing let is not get to that point find new reliable sources and quote them properly or leave the article alone mr darcy talk the story is unsubstantiated there is no other than jay glazer who has said that this has occurred favre himself tells a completely different story glazer is story becomes nothing more than a he said he said without anyone else backin it the fact that you would threaten to block my ability to edit is ludicrous you are not an administrator here if you change my information should i threaten to have you blocked as well how about this if you have me blocked from editing i shall request that the same occur to you',0

entirely too much exposition for a game nobody plays this entry is gameplotstoryline is longer than the combined entries for the plotstorylines of all three movies a few hundred fans of the game may care about its story but this sort of overly detailed plot exposition does not belong in a wikipedia article smells like fans trying to save a dying game \xe2\x80\x94preceding unsigned comment added by talk \xe2\x80\xa2 contribs i agree though before seeing this section i was going to suggest splitting it off into a separate article to satisfy those who disagree i think we need a little more discussion and consensus before coming to a decision however t honestly i do not there is any need to satisfy anyone who is not content with it the cruft is barely if at all notable enough to be in this article never mind its own \xe2\x80\x94preceding unsigned comment added by talk \xe2\x80\xa2 contribs i do not think obvious personal bias against this or any game for that matter should be a motivator for any article changes \xe2\x80\x94preceding comment was added at the obvious personal bias of a few overzealous gamers is the reason the article is so bloated with trivial data to begin with i am with ookami this game just plain is not notable enough to warrant a chapter by chapter breakdown of its storyline that is what fan sites are for just checked the world of warcraft page out of curiosity and even it does not have this much detailed story description in fact it barely has any and i do not think anyone can argue which of the two games is more notable also someone further up the page here brought this issue up already under generic story why is this still being allowed i play this game i could care less that the huge exposition was taken out that was an absolutely ridiculous story summary most of the people that play the game could not tell you half of it however to kill the previous argument wow barely has a story while the matrix online is main content and selling point is the story we do not need a paragraph summary like before a mention that there have been past live events as well as a sentence or so story summary should suffice i would challenge one of you to do it as i do not think any of you know anything about the game in the current state besides that it is much weaker than world of warcraft to clarify my point above i think the storyline section is very good now it does however need the slightest mention of what has happened just for clarification the game is main selling point was not the story itself but that the players would be shaping the story which never happened and wow has plenty of story enough to fill reams of wikipages it is just that it does not belong here in that great of detail this is supposed to be an encyclopedia not a novel well since there seems to be some rough consensus that this is well overdone and that there has been no real objection to it and pending the fact that no one with the adequate experience within the game has stepped forward to trim it down and keep whatever are the key points i am going to purge ittalk per the anonip user is objection in the page history of the main article it does not matter its that simple the story is wpcruft is a broken part of an already barely notable game and the fact that something cannot be fixed or that no one is willing to does not mean you have to keep it in its current state sometimes broken things have to be thro',0

i believe the vowel length distinctions you are referring to are totally stressrelated assamese has penultimate stress and thus all secondtolast vowels are longer than other vowels this has nothing to do with the vowel being written one way or another shortening that vowel sounds strange to you because it breaks this consistent rule in assamese for lengthened vowels in certain positions however total contextual licensing of length is evidence of a lack of true vowel length distinction in the language and thus should not be transcribed',0
i am glad you appreciate the support keep in mind i have got my own biases i am a core developer and part of the founding team of ubuntu i am more upset at the way that your criticism section has been removed than i am supportive of its contents although i think every article should be structured to show multiple points of view the point of a criticism section should be to highlight notable criticism and should not exist just because i think we should include one with relevant information but i do not feel the same urgency that you do let is work together to build a strong summary of notable critics that everyone can agree with we can do that on the talk page and then move it into the article when that is done \xe2\x80\x94\xe0\xb9\x9,0

the problem that deeply concerns me is the fact that fox news attempts to claim neutrality when their own newspaper the new york post claims that they are conservative does anyone actually wholeheartedly believe they are fair and balanced it just seems to me that fnc and even msnbc are a bit more of entertainment and that cnn is the only real news outlet because they do what they are supposed to report the news and not skew it to make a political statement and it is not like fnc is moderately conservative it is more like they do and say whatever they need to to make any and all democrats look bad while completely lying about it to the viewers who actually believe that they are fair and balanced that is honestly frightening to me bill o areilly is arrogance and temper deeply bother me the point is relating all that to that user well what he did does not exactly qualify as vandalism it just violated or even though i doubt many americans would honestly disagree with that i digress that user was not right but i sighed because i know where you were coming from i am sure he would be a productive user if he learned the ropes of wikipedia udi',0

obviously i was not referring to goodfaith edits intended to help people or to help improve the article we all appreciate those i was referring to uninformed edits and reverts of edits that added to the article there is no need to lecture me on wp thanks for the offer tho this is the first time that i have seen such aggressive uninformed editing in years i was not at all trying to own the article what i was trying is making sure that informed edits go through in case you did not notice i previously asked for the article to be locked for public editing to lock out certain people including myself to ensure that only a handful of people with a demonstrated background in aviation can review edits while others could help with stylistic stuff and proper refsquoting at the end of the day i have given up now and i will not bother wasting any more time debating things here as usual interest will degrade over time and some jackasstype personalities will probably remove themselves sooner or later probably the ones who just happen to be around accidentrelated articles because of recent news coverage at the moment there is simply too much public interest and what is happening is not just a wpspecific issue there is lots of layman is discussion taking place everywhere without really adding to the quality of discussion finally what is been happening here would not be tolerated in a commercial environment with professional editors where responsibility has to be assigned to individuals encyclopedic or not again this is nothing personal and against anybody here i do realize that there are team dynamics at work here and i have seen tons of editing wars going on here not just due to my own edits so i really do not take it personally but i would hope for wikipedia to adopt some sort of policy workflow and procedures for such hot events to ensure a higher degree of qa not just based on wp senioritystatus but based on people who have some related professional background wp is not going to fail obviously but years from now the behavior tolerated here by some wannabeexperts will no longer be tolerated and corresponding procedures will be put in place to differentiate between content and markup contributions',0

it takes a crystal ball to assert that there will be a year after we do not know that this is the case at present it is impossible to do so as a result the present title is not at all temporary nor does it imply an end date it simply implies that the crisis has spanned from until and it has any assertions about the crisis spanning to an amorphous present rely on a crystal ball and also on an inherently nonconcrete notion of time that is not useful to the reader \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x98\x8e',0

diff showing an example of the disputed quote first up no vandalism has occurred this is a content dispute only comments made in an argumentative tone and accusations of sockpuppetry do not help to resolve it i do not think the quote would be such an issue if the rest of the article was fuller but when berhalter is international career is summed up in three lines it comes across as undue weight that an athlete shows confidence in the run up to a major tournament is not surprising the key is the context in which such a quote is used as the article stands now the reader is not given any information about berhalter is role at the world cup other than stating that he was an addition to the squad appending the quote to this gives the impression that it was one of the defining moments of his career as berhalter was a substitute in all three games and did not take to the field at any point in the tournament this is clearly not the case perhaps it could be referenced in a sentence such as berhalter expressed confidence in the ability of the usa team in run up to the tournamentczechs and balances us foe able aching the boston globe june but was an unused substitute in all three group games the usa was eliminated after finishing bottom of group d with one draw and two defeats though this involves a certain amount of word juggling to get the quote to fit',0

mar utc full names i made a mistake in my comment about my edit however is there any policy about full names see george w bush apr utc general style guidelines indicate once you use a person is full name in an article you do not have to use it again for readability of course there are exceptions for instance if you were discussing george w bush and george hw bush in the same article it would only make sense to be more specific apr utc the madness never ends quotes quotes mentioned should be in wikiquotes not here \xc2\xa0 apr utc i am not a crook never obstructed justice text of press conference extracted version neither of the above partial and incomplete transcripts contain nixon is quote or the question to which he responded you can not find it in the official text of httpwatergateinfojudiciaryappipdf or the extrated version cause it is not there the house judiciary committee which was holding the watergate hearings it appears did feel question is on nixon is personal finances and taxes returns were not germane to thier proceedings sounds like a conspiracy theory to me i am sure there is a transcript out there that contains both the question asked of nixon as well as his response that the plumbers have not gotten to yet july utc from facts on file volume no oct pg the white house refused to confirm or deny an oct report in the providence ri journalbulletin that president and mrs nixon paid only in federal income taxes for and in from facts on file volume no nov pg the president made the declaration in discussing his personal finances the president was asked about a press report he paid in federal income tax in and in and whether public officials should disclose their personal finances still no transcript of the question above accuracy and pov of the above quotes questionable as well persoanl presidnet inbcome so i am a half blind clutz who can barely type words per minute nonetheless they are accurate citations that can be found in virtually any public library i did not mean to demean your typing skills i make my fair share of mistakes as well my intent was to point out that the above extracts from facts on file do not specifically relay the content of the question to which nixon was responding when he mentioned never having obstructed justice july utc new york times article by r w apple november the above cited nytimes article does not present the question to which nixon responded you will find this in virtually all press accounts of the event because the question had nothing to do with watergate the best they can do is call it watergate related or allied actually you are incorrect the post article specifically states that he was responding to watergate related questions of course he is talking about his personal finances and taxes when he says he has never profited from his position but that is not the whole quote you seem to keep evading discussion on the part where he also denies obstructing justice i believe that if we had a transcript of exactly what he is responding to it would go a long way to clearing things up july utc it does however support the fact that the cursory investigations were indeed related to the watergate investigations after months of torment over the watergate and allied scandals the president gave detailed answers to more than a dozen questions further support that nixon is quote and the watergate scandal are at least somewhat related can be found in the washington post article here declaring that i am not a crook president nixon vigorously defended his record in the watergate case tonight and said he had never profited from his public service in an hourlong televised questionandanswer session with associated press managing editors mr nixon was tense and sometimes misspoke but he maint',0

take swift stern action against this guy hi sue long time how are you i visit wikipedia only occasionally these days i just came across this i think you should give crossmr a stern warning of npa and civil on his talk page and i think you should remove that despicable pa and uncivil commentcheck out the headingedit of the comment edit summary etc from royaa is talk page or let me know if i should personally give him that warning and remove that despicable comment myself i would be happy to do that thanks it seems that crossmr is acting with a malicious instigative agenda he keeps rambling on about old things and keeps repeating himself and his instigations about them it seems that he is unable to move on and let peace reign and is hung up on old alreadysettled bloated issues not to mention nonissues he seems to want to live in the past and to think that this guy goes around placing warnings of civil and npa on other user is talk pages talk about missing the plank for the speck tsk tsk lol he should pay attention to his own block log and history lol he also needs to learn properly about agf and pipe down his illintended comments are obviously malicious and deliberately provocative but instead of me being provoked he only serves to amuse me hahahahahahahaha but it has to be made clear to him that his uncivil rants are totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated i think coming from an admin will make him a general user understand better thanks and regards ps if first time newbie issues like first time misinformed vandalism are brought up especially from their ips almost everyone on wiki would be old vandals because almost no one is expected to know wiki rules when they start editing on a whim via google one fine day hahahahaha bite agf etc also was looking to merge those accounts and attribution etc but never really got around to doing it though i think i had already mentioned it on one of the accounts user pages and also the edit histories and everything else is so very obvious i had myself mentioned that those are my accounts in my comments not to mention the archive lol seriously agf in underlined bold for some people lolol',0

in response to userviridae telling me that we were going to lots of trouble over something that would be deleted anyway i said meh let the guy feel happy i have put a on credit card to satiate now corrected to say placate him i figure it will not do any harm and can be removed ifwhen the article goes bye bye i just want him to stop pinging me on irc with his s \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2talk why i said all those thingstaking them one at at time first sentence i do not mind doing a lot of work to help someone out even if i think that it is towards something that will eventually be deleted i feel that the simple act of responding to someone else is good faith request for help is inherently worthy of my time second sentence you seemed to be concerned over people is ability to find your article and impatient about how nothing was being done about it what i did was to add something that would enable people to find your article and address your apparent concern third sentence i wasam fairly certain that the afd discussion i linked to earlier will result in deletion of the article and its associated articles including the article that i linked to using especially since the first time it was there it was a unanimous decision to delete this is no reflection on you it is merely that i do not think the article is sufficiently noteworthy for inclusion on wikipedia given our standards i do not think any harm is done by linking to it but if your article is deleted we will need to remove the link to it fourth sentence every time you use it creates a new alert in the irc channel i was trying to get you to join it is quite annoying when people repeatedly use it i hope that clarifies things i thought that i had helped you in pointing you towards the afd explaining where to find things and the rationale behind their movement the fact that i disagree with you about the inclusion of the article should not invalidate all the help i gave should it that does not seem right to me i am sorry if you felt that i was being egregiously unhelpful i want you to know that i have argued on your behalf against blocking you but if you continue to threaten disruptive behavior to make a point regarding your feelings of unjust deletion i will no longer be able to assume good faith please feel free to leave a civil message on my talk page any time you wish i will respond promptly unless stated otherwise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2talk',0

new review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient dna wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth i have been reading university textbooks on human genetics for fun since the s and for even longer i have been visiting my state flagship university is vast biomedical library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy on the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate to build an encyclopedia i thought i would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles the wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources the guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable thirdparty published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge the guidelines consistent with the general wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources remind us that all wikipedia articles should be based on reliable published secondary sources emphasis in original they helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences by contrast a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic the general wikipedia guidelines let us know that articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible for example a review article monograph or textbook is better than a primary research paper when relying on primary sources extreme caution is advised wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human dna including dna from ancient individuals earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples fewer genes and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times as more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the earth is surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in africa talk',0

celtic language it says in the article that after st patrick was captured he began to learn the celtic language it is commonly agreed among irish historians that the irish are not actually celtic eg the irish learned the celtic style of art from communication with the european mainland etc so did they speak the celt language i defer to an expert on this one to be more precise what the article means is that he learned a goidelic language or the old irish language patrick would have already spoken a brythonic language and some latin depending on exactly where he came from in britain he might have known a goidelic language as well celtic languages and insular celtic languages explain how goidelic and brythonic may have been related to each other and to other celtic languages talk are you kidding please identify your source in claiming that is commonly agreed among irish historians that the irish are not actually celtic recent research has revealed that the celts did not displace preceltic peoples but celts did come to ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until english colonization second gaeilge is a celtic language of the qceltic branch of the celtic language family thus the irish of patrick is day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that patrick learned said language ergo he learned a celtic language though as noted above he probably already spoke a pceltic brythonic language prior to his enslavement i have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the british isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the roman empire these not only include picts scots irish angles and saxons and more bizzarely english i will have to dig the book out with dates st patrick fact and fiction i have removed was captured by niall noigiallach as it is an obvious error i will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material what are the sources for the following statments born patricius magonus sucatus seems to have studied at the monastery of l\xc3\xa9rins on the c\xc3\xb4te dazur from to he spent the next years at auxerre were he became a disciple of saint germanus of auxerre and was ordained possibly about saint germanus consecrated patrick bishop about and sent him to ireland to succeed saint palladius the first bishop who had died earlier that year there was some contact with the pope patrick visited rome in and popular devotion to patrick began in france long before sucat received the noble title of patricius these and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place the fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of patrick is life are those of arriving in ireland and death are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments thank you i have rerevised the article again in line with what i wrote above for the simple reason that pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments i take issue with i dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia but it seems i have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite pm th april i did where i just checked through my edits and all i can find is reverts of blatant vandalism and one weird edit documented below i also reverted confession confessio in the last two weeks or so is this what you are referring to talk apr utc hello pete glad to hear from you the basic issues i have with the article as you wrote it forgive me if i have mistaken you for another editor are outlined above i have no problem whatsoever with them being included in an article concerning pat so long as they are placed under some heading along the lines of speculations about st patrick because we know so very little about patrick i really feel it is vital to seperate facts speculation and hagiography and i mean no offense much of what i have outlined above falls under the latter two categorys thank you for your time',0

the net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content plus which there is more to say about each individual rate construction particulars for instance plus it does not work with the categorization system when thinking about merging articles one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it is new and needs more content or it will always be small in the case of the rn rates all have much to say about them rationale evolution employment plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like this article should be about the system as a whole who introduced it and why when did it go out of use how did it compare to other nations systems once you have adequate treatment of all that plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate that is a pretty hefty article no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of thirdrate when considering organization like this it is worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned and maybe query the editors who set it up because what you have effectively done is to destroy article structure that i and others carefully set up some time ago talk pages are mostly used for debate so lack of talk page bits combined with multiple editors in history indicates that all the editors agreed perfectly no need to discuss sep utc',0
hello that is not right this is only so if in each place a significant proportion of the population lives there or are the majority i was times in nordern serbia and i have seen villages and towns where only the serbian city name exists also in the road signs at the city entrance so dont tell me this on numerous road signs in many countries of western europe germany france holland there are more minorities and whose number is much much larger and there are the city names in german language only berlin cologne dusseldorf ect i have no problem with any language but i hope to enjoy in the frame of wp the equal rights for all as well as justice and above all no double moral in vukovar i do not see that you are striving so to put serbiancyrillic version in the infobox and there ar serbians over in croatia there are also other locations where serbs and other minorities live but their share of the total population is not so much so i added not there the serbian name so it should be also in serbia in novi sad are not even of hungary and for the city names in other languages where are the minorities of a city are not significante we have the section name so what ist the problem if the hungarians in novi sad i will add the hungarian citiy name but they arent in other locations thats totaly ok becaus they are the hungarians the majority but in novi sad no after your version every location must have name in the infobox and the road sig ns but forget it i and you not thats not true so dont tell me this i visited the whole balkan times in the whole world novi sad is official or do you see for wien the serbian city name bec so accept the piecfull situation and consensus like before wher we was agreed to put the city name of a minority language if they have share of the total population please dont start this battle again i am not the problem forget not one wp does not accept double standard',0

just noticed the excellent argument by john carter above that the christian mythology category would be categorizing this page up from its present subcategory of abrahamic mythology but i rather agree with what i think martinevans said that the two are overlapping but christian mythology is not necessarily a subcategory of abrahamic mythology christian mythology would include things like the legends of the saints in the golden legend and so on would it not calling those abrahamic seems somewhat anachronistic given how removed they are geographically and temporally from the hebrew bible furthermore if this article discusses specifically christian not jewish or muslim interpretations of the myth in question at any point i am not a topic expert and i have not looked at the article in much detail anyway then adding a category that befits that would be appropriate \xe8\x81\x96\xe3\x82\x84\xe3\x82\x84',0

\xe2\x86\x92 from wpthird opinion the inclusion of that section gives undue weight to a particular prehungary period in this article hungary such material would be better placed at hungarian prehistory or pannonian basin before the hungarians with links to great moravia where appropriate the current article is almost kb long and needs more concise summaries more than it needs additional sections when deciding how much space and depth to devote to a particular aspect of a topic it is important to take recourse to general sources and reflect their coverage beyond the reliable sources threshold the trustworthiness of a particular source is less important for determining weight in the treatment of a topic than is its generality as an outsider i could see adding up to a few dozen words based on the lingering impact of toponyms and script as a side note please remember to stay focused on improving the article without recourse to personal attacks on other editors as well i remind you that whenever text is copied from one article to another you must include this fact in your edit summary cont',0

i must say that i am shocked that there is nothing about demographics in this article because i think a lot of people are going to be coming to this article for that kind of information they want to know about the percentages of men compared to women ethnicities social practicies and stuff i tink it would be fair to add that even though it is not a gay disease or anything like that there is science explaining why homosexuals get more hiv for example some not all do it in the bootyhole with other men unprotected and it does not stretch the way the vag does which means it is more likely to cause tearing and bleeding and that means gay sex will cause more hiv when unprotected by the condom the connection betweeen hiv and sex education affluence geography and attitudes might be what people come here to know also',0

second time of asking do you know which player is being wrongly attributed by bluemoon with the goal that james claims in his book tommy booth scored in the angloscottish cup game against sheffield united can you also give me the page reference so that i can include it in a footnote i would also like a page reference for the honved ucwc cup tie team lineup so i can include that in the footnote i have already written which you need to validate against james and let me know that you agree with it i got a little ahead of myself in writing that particular footnote i claim in it that james has book playing in the game with booth taking no part in the match i happen to know that to be true because i saw city play every home game that season that obviously does not help me with the away fixture at honved but i definitely do remember him being out during one of his main seasons during the period i was a regular in the kippax due to his having an operation on his knee to fix his cruciate ligament booth doyle and oakes were almost regular fixtures in the team at that time playing every game so his absence from that mighty midfield triumvirate and heslop taking over the ch role is something that i do still remember years later although until this issue came up to jog my memory i would not have been able to pin it down to the autumn of i am surprised i even recall it after so long a period but google is your friend once you know what you are looking for so i have now found a few articles out there that prove he could not possibly have played in that game but that is all bytheby the footnote is not about my own uncitable knowledge and fond memories it addresses what bluemoon states versus what james states in the book and i have no idea what james states until you tell me but if it is not in line with what i have already written then we have a big problem finally to round things out could you also send me a page reference for der bombers appearance in the barnet game and i will add that to his footnote in the same manner as i included your page reference for the coventry city match which i was also at in paul power is footnote thanks',0

well that is ridiculous as metacritic is the ultimate source for aggregate reviews the website is purpose is to provide a summary of all reviews and it is silly to ignore what it has provided our attempts at summarizing reviews and coming up with a subjective mixed status seems futile when metacritic has done the work for us and provided a different and more objective response of generally positive',0

i disagree including ambiguous names is not helpful especially where there are unambiguous names that have already been introduced to the reader the fact that fishermen use other names does not mean that we have to in this context it does not make sense to switch from justifiably calling it crangon crangon in one section to brown shrimp in another it significantly reduces the coherence of the whole article i have not removed or altered any of the statements you have added merely reformatted them to fit the context feel free to change the section heading but do not introduce vague terminology where it is not needed',0

not sure what you are getting at here or the point your at attempting to make hand loaders reloaders do not look at saamicip when they create their own ammunition while i do not speak german i can read and comprehend articles note i have in the past used german articles as references if that is what you mean i am still working on the article and remains incomplete however one does not look at an individual is reloaded data and give it credence from a wikipedia standpoint factory manufactured ammunition should only be listed for illustrative purposes and for good reason they respect a standard which is safe in a vast majority of caliber specific firearms conversely if no standard is maintained for a given cartridge then data from reloading manuals should suffice i am well aware that wsm components are available in europe a cursory check on component sellers websites evidence this bgo however i am certain that those reloading are not dragging pressure measuring instrumentation and pressure testing their ammunition against saami or cip standards not sure what is being alluded to in the sb looks like fmj but they do not manufacture wsm ammo it is certain that the wsm will become another also ran cartridge certainly rifle trends show that much this was an mm cartridge designed from the us and canadian markets and was a commercial flop from the beginning but what does that have to do with anything in the end really it is still a cartridge and should be treated in an objective manner on the wiki just like any other article yes the mm is is established in europe and the mm rws much less so but is hanging on the rem mag is dead and almost buried and has both feet firmly planted in the the grave so what',0

i disagree that wpmedrs compliance inst required by ga criteria an article must be stable for ga and fa in plants articles one of the biggest battles had by plant editors is the attempt by editors to assert false health claims in articles often to advertise products but also just by editors overly devoted to using wikipedia to promote nonmainstream medicine this then leads to edit wars blocks etc medrs helps to prevent this by requiring that health claims have a very specific type of sourcing if this is not met by this article the article will not be stable',0

rodaway himself admits that he is not the final opinion on the matter but the evidence he presents in his book bolsters his argument on culhwch ac olwen is dating the date favored by bromwich et al was always based on flimsy evidence anyway as far as we can tell the character of peredur m efrawc did not exist prior to chretien de troyes writing perceval so there can hardly have been a prechretien peredur tale the fact that the character is name was drawn from a welsh translation of geoffrey of monmouth the earliest mss of which dates to the mid th century century further supports the argument that peredur is postchretien regarding your question about courtly material i do not really understand your point obviously a welsh author familiar with french culture could have incorporated elements from it into a native tale but that does not seem to be the case here as there is no evidence for a prenorman peredur tale what we have here is a welsh author reacting to french perceval romances and adding in some traditional welsh motifs to make the story more palatable to a welsh audience',0

anyone who claims that ethnic jews can not be ethnic germans obviously subscribes to a completely outdated racist definition of ethnicity talkgermans is full of clearly racist statements by this user and this is relevant to the behavioural problem example a person can choose an identity like an italian american can see his main identity as american and not feel italian in any way but ethnically he will still be italian it is not changeable it is your genes where your ancestors came from i do not see what is your problem just admitting the fact that jews are a separate ethnicity einstein never identified as a german but for a reason a few germans here insist on having some ownership on him after trying to kill him and his people hans adler',0

adultchild sex child sexual abuse copied from wpani ohio i have asked this question before but i have never had an understandable explanation how is the article a pov fork if it is been explained previously just point me to the diff i have seen plenty of people say it is a pov fork but what i see is a valueneutral etic approach to a topic that is as old as humanity itself even if the title is pov the content can be used in other articles so why delete it ohio adultchild sex is a euphemism for child sexual abuse and any article titled adultchild sex is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse exactly as if someone took an article nazi genocide and retitled or made a fork entitled nazi demographic adjustments we understand that you do not agree with this but if you still do not understand it then you had better look to yourself exactly as hero said as a contemporary example ethnic cleansing and genocide one is just a fancy name for the other \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 utc mar i do not see the logic of that adultchild sex the term goes no further than plain description i can see where some editors were trying to insert pov material about child sexual abuse into the article but i do not see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse the term itself can advance no agenda it is materially different from the genocide demographic adjustments example which may invoke godwin is law as for vp is example ethnic cleansing means something different from but related to genocide just as adultchild sex does with child sexual abuse the repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is pov where is the pov in it since this seems not to be much of an ani question i invite replies at my talk page ohio',1

sentence pardon me if i make a mistake here i have not had breakfast and i am about to go out re when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is the reference only provides one example accepted to college as far as i have read the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long but in a dialect form for longer sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again to be defended on its age would not it not be clearer to elaborate on linguistic matters it is difficult to guess them solely from one example that an expression is newer than it actually is if the sentence were clearer it would easier to verify it',0

title lara love year director anonymous aspect ratio synopsis the film begins with a knock on lara is door the man whose face is not seen is welcomed by lara they talk about how the day has gone the film then skips to a scene where lara is seen from the man is point of view continuing their talk in a bar slightly intoxicated at this point the man slips a few rohypnol tablets into her drink all becomes a blur then the film skips to a scene of a visibly confused lara in a dark unidentified location her facial muscles struggle to move as she clearly tries to resist in vain the advances of the man who begins tearing her clothes off soon afterwards the man drops his own clothing and proceeds to insert his bare erect penis into her rectum without lubrication after some struggle from the woman she eventually concedes and gives in to the constrictions of the phallus which by this point is starting to gather fecal matter along the course of its shaft the film ends with a closeup of the unknown man is semen resting at the entrance to her rectum',0

hi elen apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag i have generally seen your own actions as even handed and i would extend this comment to a few of the other editors all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how wikipedia works internally i confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and i point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for jwasm i bothered to write for wikipedia the same antagonist tried to trash the masm page that i rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again an earlier editor tried to get some content into the masm page by scouring the masm web site and linking to web pages that i wrote for the masm user base and while i was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the masm page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed in the face of endless obstruction i will simply resolve the problem from outside wikipedia you are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up regards and thanks for your efforts',0

involvement of children tiamut i realize that this is a sensitive section requiring extra caution but i do not think that adding according to x when x is obviously an rs is the way to go it is not customary and the whole point of an rs is that the facts have been reliably verified and are not simply the perspective of the source is author if you suspect that the facts presented by professor rosen are only a partial picture of the situation in the s i suggest you find other reliable sources that may focus on other aspects on a related note while this article like all of wikipedia is a work in progress i think the situation of this section is appalling until i added material from rosen most of the section dealt with a single incident and half of that was a description of a spat between israel and the bbc that resulted from the incident quite peripheral if you ask me as i started editing the article only recently i am hesitant to remove any material but i think the incident should be cut to sentences and the subsequent spat removed altogether obviously more general content dshould be added and i may do so if i have the time',0

to quote the architect the matrix is older than you know i prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next in which case this is the sixth version the first matrix i designed was quite naturally perfect it was a work of art flawless sublime a triumph equaled only by its monumental failure the inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being thus i redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature however i was again frustrated by failure i have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection thus the answer was stumbled upon by another an intuitive program initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche if i am the father of the matrix she would undoubtedly be its mother possibly v v also had ones the architect speaks of the anomaly being ineradicable despite his best efforts in which case it would be present in the eutopia and dystopia versions too this would explain why the architect speaks of each version being identified by its anomaly yet also says the first matrix i designed regarding the eutopia version ie v',0

utc by your last sentence april it would seem that we are perhaps getting a little closer to nub of our discussion the article is about his work the fact that a very large amount of his original work some negetives has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately years is one of the main planks of his notability the other plank is when and where he practiced the subjects of his photographs the people their clothes their floating and their static palaces etc etc is what is notable this collection is a unique historical visual record of a long dead era it is not just a collection of photos of old boats kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society that aspect of society existed here and there now and then throughout this and other countries but it came together for a short period each year at cowes in what i have called a distillation he did photograph it and his work has remained together its existence until recently known only to a small group the trustees of the two collections feel i am sure that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet in any event that would be impractical and was not my intention my plan had been to try to make the collection is scope known not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information as an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page of today is guardian the article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance the collection was started as the fawcett library biographical details of millicent fawcett are not central to the theme of the article an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is may',0

the alternative theories section i have been away on other things and have not got to starting the alternate theories section yet nothing mysterious has happened to me i think it is safe to start on a foreknowledge section and a dissenting government officials section i did look at what it was saying about that one bin laden tape on mythscom and admit that when you see the whole tape some shots look considerably more like bin ladin than others the bit about the ring when islam prohibits it is still out of place that guy laughs a lot too bin laden does not seem to be the kind who has a good sense of humor but it did seem a more informal situation still the video is darker and has poor resolution so that may account for some of the difficulty i downloaded a lowresolution video from cnncom of the second plane hitting the tower and there is a red spot offcenter from the plane just before it strikes similar to those in loose change but i guess i need to quit being cheap and just order some of the documentaries to get better resolution i have read about half of a page on able danger somebody pointed out to me above and it is interesting this may not be quick but as it is a minority view we will not be able to get into much depth here anyway thanks for helping guard the wikipedia content btw guys i hope there is a way to ban outright vandals by ip mask not userid',0

if someone feels that an editor has been editing disruptively it is perfectly in order for them to report it to administrators to consider whether any action should be taken it is a matter of courtesy to warn the user in advance that doing so is being considered and to give the editor a chance to stop in fact a report to administrators is likely to be simply dismissed if no warning has been given first i do think that more friendly wording might have been used rather than i will report you to wikipedia admins and have you blocked but i have seen far more uncivil warnings than that the ip editor has just given you that one message since your last edit to the article and since you say that you are done with the article it may be that heshe will leave it at that if the ip editor persists in posting to you about it after you have stopped editing the article then please come back and tell me as that may well be harassment and action may well be needed but if what has happened so far is the end of it then i do not see any reason for not just letting it drop',0

everybody you are wrong everyone here except bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two this is not about what anyone thinks it is about reliable sources in this case the label of a vinyl record it is also about reality and as usual people here are trying to make wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia so in a nutshell it does not really matter what any of you think if you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one rather than beginning again from track one by all means it should be noted in the article because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public as well as a reliable source problem solved by arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world you are using original research which some people here tend to frown upon as far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering even today is young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different sides being numbered differently i also do not agree that the sides should be eliminated completely an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release which for most of the best music ever recorded is vinyl it is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately not to revise it \xe2\x80\xa2talk\xe2\x80\xa2',0

blp continues to tout the idea of using these hydrinos in products like super good anticorrosion coatings for ships great in years have they supplied any of this hydrino product to coating manufacturing if i understand correctly mills did not publicize hydrino hydrides until spring of that is less than years ago also consider that in addition to this discovery they are also touting the more recent solidfuel hydrino reactor as well as the ciht fuel cell before all that was the discovery of plasma based systems it is easy to see why this might years or more to develop or more simply have they done an experiment where they recover the water from their experiments that allegedly recover energy from water and keep using that water and notice as the build up hydrinos increases the ability of the water to supply energy declines they do not try to reform the water after taking the hydrogen out of it in the ciht cell design once the hydrogen is used the oxygen is incorporated in other oxygen species which serve various functions in the fuel cell the ability for the water to supply energy declines the moment that energy is extracted from them rendering them as non water there are no indications in the paper that recombination of two hydrinos with one atom of oxygen will form water or that further energy would be extracted by catalytic reaction of such water nor is any importance placed upon trying to measure the amount of such water as a separate item from normal h the interest here primarily is not the notion of recycling water for further extraction of energy but rather the interest here is to allow the electron of hydrogen atoms to fall to lower fractional orbitals below ground state and allow that energy to be harness through an electrochemical fuel cell via absorption of energy by ions\xe2\x80\x94expert sectioneer of wikipedia karma talk my objection to the characterization of rowan as an a source of independent research on blp theories was at least partially based on this issue where is it that rowan showed a hint of independent thought about the experiments they did did they ask questions like this and do independent testing to try to ferret out answers or did they work as paid technicians that did exactly the experiments that blp paid them to run and only report their results after blp had approved the reports has blp ever done an experiment which proved that they could distinguish between water with hydrinos and water that does not have hydrinos to my knowledge mills has not made it clear that two hydrinos could combine with an oxygen atom and this is perhaps because the nature of them would be rather unclear at this time thus not justifying and publication of claims regarding that issue any questions specifically about this probably have no solid answers at this time so it would not be surprising if no information could be gathered that rowan scientists asking these sorts of questions because that would probably not be available until the questions have good answers blp is not the type that publishes a question that it does not have an answer to so it keeps mention of such to a minimum until better data can be gathered so answers to your questions are as far as i know are not publicized not publicized yes no as far as my view about whether or not rowan constitute independent research\xe2\x80\x94it is not\xe2\x80\x94expert sectioneer of wikipedia karma talk',0

a theory is comprised of research findings you are talking about research findings and theory as if they were two separet things there is no distinction between research findings and theory what they first two comments are telling is that the research method and the theory should be split into two articles the research method is called social network analysis and the theory is called social network theory a researcher uses social network analysis to produce information about a phenomenon called social network and the sum of findings constitute social network theory therefore there is no distinction between theory and research findings but there should be a distinction between a sepecific research method and a theory thus the article whould be split into two articles as social network and social network analysis',0

the sources i brought up except all the media group connected to niezaleznapl are also wppl rppl uakronedu gazetaprawnapl sejmgovpl naszdziennikpl stefczykinfo videos on youtube and some others i could also bring sources like uwarzamrzepl wpolitycepl wprostpl onetpl and many others but niezaleznapl seems to provide the most of information on that investigation the most detailed you can always say they are political rightwing etc and you can always call every investigation of any crime a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical game\xe2\x80\x9d because there is almost always someone who could benefit on it\xe2\x80\xa6 but there is an interesting thing if the law and justice party and all the \xe2\x80\x9crightwing extremists\xe2\x80\x9d are pushing a faketheory of an assassination then why they are all demanding an international investigation on it and all the others are so afraid of it what do they have to hide why the law and justice party runs the risk of an international shame and loss of all the voters support if it was really an accident what you are trying to defend here is a theory of a ghostplane flying under the ground smashed by one of the armored birches that grow only in russia\xe2\x80\xa6 and you don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s a fringe conspiracy theory it\xe2\x80\x99s an official true version just because the terrorists ruling in russia responsible for many other political murders \xe2\x80\x93 will you deny that said so because they led an investigation on it and the polish government confirmed it and all the mainstream media repeated it and then all the international media repeated after them what else should they do and the only other investigation with a rational conclusion with a hypothesis of explosions is a \xe2\x80\x9cfringe theory\xe2\x80\x9d that has to be removed also one thing i have to add here do you know anything about the war between georgia and russia in and the role of l kaczynski there do you know that he gathered four other countries leaders lithuania estonia ukraine latvia went to tbilisi and forced russian army to stop the attack on georgia see do you know there was already an assassination attempt on him right there in georgia see do you know that the katynmassacre was also a revenge however after all i\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you finally focused on merits and try to find some other explanation for the explosions that about the fuel tanks then the official reports must be lies too as i know the fuel has to be mixed with airoxygen in some proportion to explode otherwise with a surfacecontact with air it fires slowly however it is all to be investigate by an international commission and about the balance in the article the only reliable theory is about of contents and you say it\xe2\x80\x99s too much',0

well i am not participating to this discussion to solve a personal problem actually i am not going to use geometric algebra i just want to know if there is a convenction or not and i thought it was interesting to show that any preference has its pros because you seemed to be interested in defending a particular preference do you mean you never look at numbers to understand if your calculations are correct there exist some people i guess who use geometric algebra for practical purposes people who express measured or estimated physical quantities using multivectors and if they do they for sure are going to look at the numbers results must be interpreted discussed understood programs must be tested their output cannot be accepted blindly then results may be shared may be sent to other people or the output of a function may be used as input for another function and this is why i believe a convention might be useful see relevance',0

i have come across variations on draughts as i have always called it we had a compendium of games that came in a cube it had six sides on it one of which was a checkered board for playing chess and draughts on with draughts apart from the traditional version there were the following variations dammspiel that is what the manual called it i think it is also called damenspiel you set them up a bit like chess but they were placed one square forward hard to explain the pieces moved almost identical to regular draughts diagonally one square i think the kings could move multiple squares a bit like the flying kings rule people have mentioned except that you stop short of capturing my memory is hazy on the issue turkish checkers similar settup to dammspieldamenspiel it looks a bit like chess with draughts pieces the setup being on the same squares you would use for draughts pieces move one square forwards and if i remember rigtly capture diagonally like standard draughts the kings i believe move like rooks in chess and jump only once in a straight line again my memory is hazy regarding the rules one game not listed in the manual was a game known by one of three names arrow draughts dagger draughts or kings played similar to standard draughts you play it cornertocorner and set the pieces up as kings in the shape of an arrow or dagger you then play it like regular draughts i have played draughts with at least three opponents a relative somebody at school and somebody i once shared a house with and they were convinced that a single man can not take a king apparently according to this page that is the rules in italian draughts',0
selfaggrandizing pov the phrase selfaggrandizing has been removed several times for two reasons it is wppovpov it is redundant apparently because it is made clear by the rest of the article i am not sure either of these reasons are valid what pov is the selfaggrandizing phrase pushing it does not seem to be something either the gnaa is supporters or detractors would disagree with making it unclear whether or not it is pov at all it seems to simply be an indisputable fact evidenced by among many other things the article itself as well as the gnaa is website also if the statement is not pov it can not be said to be inappropriately unbalancing the article by including the pov of one side and not the other that the gnaa are a selfaggrandizing group is a simple fact another reason given for the phrase is removal was that it was redundant that might be the case but is not redundancy not only acceptable but desired in the first paragraph of an article which is generally supposed to act as a summary i am really not sure why this phrase is causing so much controversy',0

new study by mark regnerus sociology professor at the university of texas a new study conducted by mark regnerus an associate professor of sociology at the university of texas has revealed among other things that of children aged to whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting compared to only of children from heterosexual families it also showed that of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult compared to of children from heterosexual families and that of them have had sex against their will compared to from heterosexual families the study stresses however that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent is sexual orientation the study also shows that of those with lesbian parents and of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide compared to of those from heterosexual families children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy for a problem connected with anxiety depression or relationships of children compared to of children from heterosexual families furthermore of children with lesbian parents and of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease compared to of children from heterosexual families of children with lesbian parents and of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to of children from heterosexual families adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested due to the findings it is very controversial and that is why my edit here httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitlehomosexualityandpsychologydiff oldid and here httpenwikipediaorgwindexphptitlelgbtparentingdiff oldid has been undone simply because another user disagreed and claimed the study is widely criticized and flawed criticized by whom it is a new study nobody had yet written an article debunking it flawed according to whom your personal opinion that is not a reason to vandalise the article and undo my edit the study is published and available here httpwwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis x the fact that this is not allowed on the article prior a discussion is unfair what difference does it make they are findings from a study how could a talk about it make any difference do we have to come to an agreement to put this information into the article itself and if we do not we will just ignore it and purposely leave the study out of the article because somebody is opinion about it disagrees this is not objective and completely unprofessional not to mention biased this is nothing more than intentionally leaving a study out of the article because somebody disagrees with the findings there is no valid honest objective reason to remove this information from the article yet i was forced to open a talk about it because of no other reason than somebody not liking the results of the study this is unacceptable yet here i am anyway opening a talk about it so what is there to discuss your opinion disagreeing with the results that is not a reason and is completely subjective in other words it is irrelevant there is absolutely nothing to talk about',0

inclusion of details of artie lange is suicide before official confirmation is inappropriate i do not feel remotely comfortable about this the addition of details about lange is alleged suicide attempt i fear that editors would get their panties in a bunch if i attempted to remove sourced information so i would really like to get a second opinion here are my issues with the source the new york post is a wellknown publication but it is also a salacious tabloid with a track record of printing vast amounts of harmful and meanspirited gossip that is not to say that we should never use the post as a source but in this case it seems hopelessly shady if you read the article it uses only vague anonymous sources and does not allude to any confirmation from hospital or law enforcement authorities or from artie is family or representatives most importantly the anonymously sourced article is the only news source claiming artie has stabbed himself all other articles covering the suicide attempt refer to the new york post as their only reference until some independent confirmation of artie is status can be given it does not seem appropriate to reprint such sensitive and personal details in a blp note this post has also been copied to the blp noticeboard',0
i am simply asking that wiki stands be applied and not the sensibilites of a warring faction i would agree that this is not high on any scale of importance what the issue is to me is that is wiki going to allow open editing o nthis article or is pats going to get to delete anyhting he chooses and claim nonnotable if so then greater wiki principles are violated because one guy thinks he wpowns an article and he and his followers can shoutdown dissenters by false claims of majority rules so to the substance i do not want to overstate the importance of this but i do not want it to be understeded either the speech is what it is nothing more nothing less i do not think making comparisons to other players and their speeches suits this discussion because i could point out hundreds of things in nfl project articles that are not notable in someone is opinions so on the merits this is verifiable and it is a npov it is notable because it is national press i have never seen that conference mentioned in usa today ever i have read that paper since or so now could i have missed it in previous years sure however i think it got national news becasue of who was speaking that ends the discussion really a separate discussion is whether it should be in the article but one step at a time it is notable under wiki standards under wiki guidelines yes is it npov yes is is verfiable yes can it be deleted because of majority rule no should a real wpconsensus be reached yes',0
question not disputing that this may well be the most common name now but what was the reasoning behind the term i would have naturally guessed that it meant people born after but these people were born in some indeterminate time span before the millennium does it signify people who were high school age when the millennium turned or something like that we should get the etymology behind the term millennial in a source and add it to the article either way talk',0

i apologize for cursing you out i lost my temper and it was unacceptable i am completely deserved a block although i think you had no right to give it to me that said looking at the last few pages of your contributions nearly all your edit summaries are mosed reverted unexplained and unsourced changes tidied copyedit or similar i am sure i was overstating the case because i was angry but this does seem to be your main activity in the main space on wikipedia not that there is anything wrong with that it is good to have people who copyedit and so forth but i think my basic claim was more or less true and i do not misunderstand the way wikipedia works i have been here for four years and i have never run into anyone demanding sources for utterly uncontroversial statements the way that you are if we are obsessive about this kind of thing wikipedia will never grow and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge and i think my understanding of this is a lot closer to the way wikipedia actually works than yours is which is based on a completely nonexistent perfect world idea of what wikipedia should be',0
i am greatly amused this is essentially a waste of my time since you evidently believe every word that you type and essentially everything you read as well st anyone who knows anything about india understands the surname workings yadavsyadavas undoubtedlyfor you to argue for such a distinction is laughable by educated and uneducated folks nd you should revisit your own sources to understand some truths rd you seem to have deliberately ignored many points made by myself and previous posters th personally i do not understand why you are against yadav is perhaps your own inferiority lends towards such traits yadav is as well as any raceethnicityetc are not nonelite such subjective language indicates your own weakness in elementary education and social awareness nonetheless live your life and the rest shall live ours enjoy editing wikipedia pages a free web service which i have and will continue to enjoy however i will not trust everything i read on here knowing well and good people like you are out there i suppose this is meaningless coming from a nonelite which has many negative connotations thanks you truly are helping humanity come together in our search for equality good jo,0

wikipedia is not a courthearing transcript well this directly contradicts wikipedia policy itself where when reputable sources contradict one another then you are required to present the differing viewpoints with clarity if this turns out to be like a courthearing transcript transcript so be it but you are misunderstanding my use of he says we do not need to specifically do that if the context makes it clear anyway npov weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence however when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence the core of the npov policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page work for balance that is describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources and give precedence to those sources that are most reliable and verifiable i have a suggestion i will write the ernst and al viewpoint and you do the other i can do mine first',0
notewhile i do agree with the view that some of the manchu rulers that ruled china until were quite nasty i do not see how a user page that pushes this view is beneficial in any way on the contrary it might send a message that proponents of this view will doing anything to make their voice heard also placing numerous links on a user page to web sites in any language other than english is usually seen as spamming',0
month topic ban on presidential campaign articles you were notified on sept that all articles related to the presidential campaign were under article probation on sept you were warned again that these three edits were trolling and provoking another user today you boldly removed a referenced section of mitt romney dog incident your edit was reverted and you immediately restored the material with an edit summary that suggests there is a consensus to do so on the talk page despite that the discussion on the talk page has not reached a consensus and is learning toward removing it you were invited to join that discussion and you chose to revert instead even going as far as to accuse another editor of personal attacks for this diff it seems to me that you have trouble editing collaboratively on these articles i am issuing a topic ban for you from presidential campaign articles for month broadly construed across all namespaces except to appeal this topic ban to wparbcom or wpani in the future you need to practice wpbrd and avoid edit warring behavior especially on articles under probationvr p',0
incompleteness as i heard the story of the carson city mint it started life as a private operation because the us treasury refused to build a branch to accommodate the comstock lode when the government attempted to close it down and prosecute the operators for counterfeiting the prosecution was defeated by the detail that the dollar coins were fractionally overweight the street price of silver in carson city was low enough to still permit a profit on the minting thus unable to prevent the minting of silver coins in carson city the treasury took over operations and pocketed the fractional overweight even if this story is inaccurate i believe the story ought to be included perhaps with its disproof but it does shed light on the issue of the discrepancy between the value of silver as a commodity and as currency',0

replaceable fair use imagejgphotojpg thanks for uploading imagejgphotojpg i noticed the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but its use in wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information if you believe this image is not replaceable please go to the image description page and edit it to add without deleting the original replaceable fair use template on the image discussion page write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all alternatively you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject requesting that the copyright holder release this or a similar image under a free license or by taking a picture of it yourself if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on this link note that even if you follow steps and above fair use images which could be replaced by freelicensed alternatives will be deleted days after this notification days if not used in an article per our fair use policy if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page thank you',0
i see your concern a better article is what i am concerned about too i have dealt with numerous kinds of text i know well about text structuring and an aspect drawing my attention striking is the linear style of the narrative and the aseptic surgical tone with onesided arguments piled up one after the other as a cv resum\xc3\xa9e can be failing to present the real extent of his actions not presenting critical approaches to his work or positions despite his being severely critized by many reputed authors and groups quite a lenghty criminal record is alleged formal rigidity covers up the real content was not that actually what the pentagon papers were about just wondering i share your concern with the cohesiveness the paragraph i embedded refers to the vietnam war context when he was in charge and is intended to clear up what his profile is both at the specific moment and in general as a person and do not intend to delete his medalsmerits from the article but offer a critical and balanced approach in the argument completely different subject well it is directly related to the matter so the reader can get the whole picture a domestic issue yes and no the course of events at home were eventually to prompt the usa pullout so both are interacting i accept suggestions anyway for another collocation or section for the paragraph in question thank you for mending ellsberg may not be a highranking official and needs a fix there may be a proper word i am not familiar to midranking official i will look into it topsecret of course they were the quotes are telling i cited what the papers revealed so that the reader gets the picture my claim of not editing is just a mirror of your claim like you i have a clear position as to the kind of figure and person kissinger is but i do not intend to make an article based on my point of view just to balance it and offer a more realistic picture of the person in question reality is dirtier so to say as i told before this is not a cv',0

words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propaganda damemk you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources i do not have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports damemk i hope you write something here at least to show that usertalkdamemk and usertalkejanev is not the same user some insight into my user name ejanev the only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev user damemk is a separate user probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name and mk or the code of republic of macedonia it does happen that i am from canada i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all it is attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia i am not the only usereditor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles you can watch the contributions of specialcontributionslaveol and see that more than of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes',0

to the one extent the trial is over yes the problem i am seeing is that a lot pf people are refusing to talk until pc is removed from every single page that uses it of interest i actually think i saw pc used in a protection situation just last month february by an administrator so apparently it is still being used by administrators at this very moment now personally i have no control to the point i can remove pc from articles or readd it so in that extent my opinion is just that an opinion nothing more if administrators are instructed to remove it they remove it and stop using it i can not go looking through the articles and remove it if i can i have no idea how i still think there is no issue with leaving it until a further decision is made it is the same argument i made for nail yakupov before it was userfied to my space even though he is a lock for rookie of the year and others said let is delay this afd because this will make him truly notable the closing admin decided to userfy neway only to make me move it back in two weeks once they announce the award yes maybe i am wpcrystalcrystalballing a bit here but the previous winner won it with a very similar performance to yakupovand probably not as many goals either so back on topicif it has to be removed admins have to do it the rest of us just have an opinion',0

some palestinian scholars are using the etymological relationship between the word pal\xc3\xa6stina and philistine to pretend that the palestinians are the remnants even are themselves the true philistines and not the descendants of arab conquerors mixed with native populations of jewish hellenistic arabic or aramaic descent who inhabited byzantine palestine before the arab conquest moreover abusing this historically inconsistent argument they go further to say that the israelipalestinian conflict dates back to biblical times linking the palestinianphilistines to their supposedly indoeuropean ancestors they argue that the jews an anachronism since at that period they did not exist as jews before the babylonian exile stole the land of the palestinians at that very early period this way of importing nazi style propaganda into the conflict is widely spread in some farright movements and has some misled followers outside those circles unfortunately many philistines use it in an undiscriminating way pure zionist bullshit deleted',0

objectivity i realize this is a very controversial topic but this article is simply not objective enough and simply demonstrates american public opinion for example it is commonly accepted outside of the united states that the fourth aircraft was downed by the us military it is possible that the us media has exercised selfcensorship and so the american public doees not have access to this information but deleting caveats such as the commission determined that or putting it under conspiracy theories simply destroys objectivity could we not have this article explaining that it reflects the commission is determinations and have a prominent link to disputes with the official account this would hopefully avoid offending people is sensitivity to the subject by keeping controversies off the main page but also thereby reflecting a wider opinion',0

saying it is a professed status is ponderous reasoning their beliefs are verifiably christian if they said we are christian but were really worshipping the flying spaghetti monster then the article should not say they are christian because they believe that jesus was the messiah the son of god and they follow his teachings as they understand them they are indisputably a christian religion regardless of extraneous definitions imposed by other groups or whether their beliefs are wrong as previously stated if other religious groups contend that jws are not christiain that belongs in the controversy section where it already is',0

stats in football players infoboxes hi when you update the stats in football players infoboxes please remember that you should also update the timestamps as of when the stats are correct this is done by updating or parameter when updating club appearances and goals or or when updating national team appearances and goals this shows when the stats were last updated and prevents editors from accidentally updating the stats again the easiest way to do this is to use five tildes which automatically converts to the current time for example please keep this in mind thank you \xc2\xa0talk',0

if there is a published source that says merv was gay then you can edit in that he was gay and cite the source deciding for yourself whether the source that someone else cited is not reliable is original research and is prohibited you may not delete factual statements that are backed up by source material simply because you say the source is unreliablethat itself is a factual assertion that needs to be backed up with sources further if you do this without siomilarly checking the reliability of all other cites in the article and deleting teh unreliable and deleting those without cites then you are obviously enforcing a point of view and you have violated npov so if you really think a cited source is unreliable especially one in support widely acknowleged fact that ol merv was gay then you had better put the kettle on because you have got your work cut out out for you then of course you will have to go back and check all the cites on all the entries you have ever contributed to seems much better to find a reliable source that says merv was straight geuss you would still bett get that kettle on',0

laugh we have had another good laugh at your comedy turn regards to aa your dog i suppose and your other two fans we all wait with baited breath to see if commons to lords comes up to our standards it will be a blow if it does not but mr maun can always rely on you to help him out after all in a couple of weeks it will be all his work you have copied to replace the crap on your website regards from all in the law department review book of the year award nominee from commons to lord is volume ian maun from a statistical and historical perspective one of the most important books of was the first volume of ian maun is series on eighteenth century cricket in fact after delving into this rich assemblage of material published in association with both the mcc and the acs it is probably true to say that this is the most important book of the past few decades this claim is based on the fact that the author who works at exeter university has meticulously unearthed many new details as well as hitherto unknown matches from the early s this book draws heavily from newspapers journals letters and other documents housed in national and provincial collections as well as other resources not generally available to or used by the majority of cricket historians including history books dictionaries novels plays and poems moreover this is not a reworking of other writers contributions as the author is not afraid to question previously published material or other works which have hitherto been accepted by historians as being chapter and verse on th century cricket indeed this book includes more than references to cricket which until now have never before been published whilst several errors and omissions have been carefully corrected and filled one can only wonder at what further riches lie in the next three volumes of this series the work stemmed several years ago from the author\xe2\x80\x99s desire to understand the relationship of the hambledon club\xe2\x80\x99s exploits to the cricket which had preceded those illustrious days what started out as a series of notes trying to disentangle what was fact and what was fiction has metamorphosed into a work which provides a sharper and more complete picture of the noble game than previously achieved by many previous authors as well as some of the great scholars of cricket history this period of tricorn hats curved bats and twostump wickets is vividly brought back to life by the yearbyyear listing of references supported by the accompanying notes and the series of beautifully reproduced images as such it is not a book which will be slavishly read time and again from cover to cover instead it is a fantastic reference book with as one would expect from someone with a strong academic background a superb set of footnotes and bibliographical tools indeed in his accompanying notes the publisher claims that this book \xe2\x80\x9cwill assuredly become the premier recourse for anybody interested in early and th century cricket history\xe2\x80\x9d i would unhesitatingly venture one step further and suggest that in years to come the author\xe2\x80\x99s name will be spoken of in the same breath as haygarth waghorn or buckley high praise indeed but so richly deserved review by andrew hignell',0

neutrality tag ok uku has tagged the article as not being neutral so what is not neutral about it respond to the points that i brought up which continue to accumulate for each instance of bullshit that you post on here i am responding to your points you just do not like what i have to say i get the idea that you equate agree with me as a valid response and do not agree with me as bullshit and once again you are attempting to avoid the question what is not neutral about the article wpcivil refers to this as feigned incomprehension learn how to scroll up nothing feigned about it i think this article is excrutiatingly neutral in tone so i really do not see how you can think otherwise in any case since you do not seem to want to discuss your concerns point by point i have responded to them all below you have not proven that this article is excruciatingly neutral you are simply reacting defensively and irrationally you may have invested a lot into it already and that may be distorting your perspective as someone looking in from the outside it appears on no uncertain terms that this article is biased in addition you have demonstrated a lack of selfcontrol compassion and objectivity which are all needed to make unbiased statements i wish i had more time to take part in the discussions these days but best guess is that current version his version therefore current version neutral i would suggest that the current version is as close as an article of this kind is going to get it reports simple facts per wpv without taking a bias as far as possible per wpnpov this is not saying that todays version can not be improved though but s changes were not an improvement off course if we were apply wpundue and wpfringe heavoly to this article we might as well delete the whole thing but thats beside the point i would argue that the neutrailty tag is misused on this article you do not have enough time to engage in discussion yet you are certain that the neutrality tag is misused and you apparently have enough time to click undo your sincerity is questionnable nice ad hominen there but perhaps you had something more usefull to add to the discusson flamebait sock puppeting responding to uku is points let is try again since you do not seem to want to discuss them point by point fine i will deal with them all together the article uses the phrase in the broadest terms which clearly shows intent to diminish or otherwise misrepresent the subject matter the exact sentence is masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving freemasonry in broadest terms these theories claim that masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving freemasonry this is a statement that summarizes a broad concept that is common to most of the theories wikipedia is style guidelines say we are supposed to summarize the article in broad scope in the intro that is what we do even a quick look at the list shows that most of the theories claim this in some way how is it not neutral it insinuates that the subject matter does not warrant serious consideration besides that phrase is not only false but exaggerated false it is a very accurate description but the meaning do not change much if we rewrite it to masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving freemasonry these theories claim that masonic conspiracy theories are a subset of conspiracy theories involving freemasonry it just turns the last sentence into a fragment and a repeat of the first as for being exaggerat',0
addition of history as can be seen i have added a new history section for the bank of liverpool previously there were just a few lines of intro i have taken it up to when the bank acquired martins bank and became the bank of liverpool and martins there already is separate article on martins which makes reference to the bank of liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive i propose continuing the bank of liverpool history to when the name was shortened to martins and possibly beyond how should the overlap with the martins bank article be treated the name change to martins is really a red herring it is the liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by barclays and therefore i suggest should be the main article one solution would be to have martins pre history as a selfcontained article with the bank of liverpool article continuing up to',0

making the majority into the minority though there has not been a claim of responsibility previous bombings in lahore have been blamed on the pakistani taliban because of their disagreement with minority interpretations of islam such as sufism i would like to know when the barelvis became a minority in pakistan it is the largest sect in pakistan even the outdated cia fact book can verify this it seems that aljazera does not know what they are talking about if anyone have a doubt about the connection between barelvis and sufis then simply read an article about barelviswhich is insufficient and at parts incorrect like many other articles here they are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belongspeaking on the individual level personally i can tell you that for a barelvi sufis are considered our elderly our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge barelvi sufi more or lessto simplify things for the reader people need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah waljamatthis would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as unlike in pakistan and india due to complexities arising due to impostors this is the largest sect in the islamic worldno quotation simply based on experience and personal research where sufis are considered as mentioned our elderly our sages our spiritual guides hence sufi is are not some sect but simply our respectable elderly the sect is called ahle sunnah waljamat an ok translation would be the people of the sunnah unlike christianity the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to hadith of the prophet muhammad saw mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one which shall happen to be the largest onefrom the hadith again seek out the source if you are interested its in the major hadith collections hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity if anyone doubts that most pakistanis are sufisbarelvisahle sunnat waljamat then simply take a look at sindh i do not have the exact number but its like sufis its only in nwfp that the majority are wahabis but that corresponds to ca less than there are shia as well in nwfp and some other sects of the total population in pakistancensus how difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy',0

pov statement which could not be salvaged i removed the following statement from the article hoping that someone will rewrite this former cia agent john stockwell who was stationed in angola while working with the cia argued that the cia murdered angolans by arbitrarily warmongeringhttpwwwinformationclearinghouseinfoarticle htmhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvc coxobeo reasons i think it is pov arbitrarily please elaborate and explain how this is relevant to the article warmongering i think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia and certainly not here there are many other better words the figure is not even mentioned in the article itself so if it is not important or noteworthy enough to put there why does it belong in a broad article about the country the figure appears to come from his recollection since when do we rely one person an activist at that to be the sole source for a casualty estimate the uss involvement is more of a side note here and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of angola is history in another article about i do not know cia activities in angola maybe but not here',0

section reliability and bias wikipedia appeals to the authority of peerreviewed publications rather than the personal authority of experts imo this statement is false as it stands wikipedia can rely on personal authority of experts within their recognized area of expertize as well as on the authority of government officials ie experts in government see wprsexceptions the idea probably was rather than on the personal authority of experts contribution ot wikipedia in any case what is the authority of peerreviewed other than the sum of the personal authorities of peers mikka a drawback of this citationonly approach is that readers may be unable to judge the credibility of a cited source an opinion not a fact requires reference what is more this statement is dubious a drawback in comparison to what do readers judge the credibility of eb authors they simply accustomed to believe in credibility of eb in fact in certain areas eb is biased as hell the most recent example that came to my attention is whitewashing their compatriot john mills in frief eb says that mills withdrew from the project of encyclop\xc3\xa9die while independent historians say he was kicked out and even banged on his head for his bad job secondly we have wprs in place to ensure that verifiably credible sources are cited mikka',0

offhand comment by ludwigs the problem here brangifer and the thing that as an academic annoys me the most is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do you are starting from a predefined judgement ie that anything notscience is bad and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position one can always find someone reputable somewhere who says what one already believes ufologists do that all the time cherrypicking quotes from scientists and government agencies but it is bad scholarship to do so you want so desperately to believe that the scientific community agrees with your radically skeptical position that you are grasping at straws that is not the way things are done ludwigs',0
i question the very supposition that natural rights should be conjoined with legal rights as i have recently brought up again below the reasoning here seems to me to suggest that there is connection between the two or at least to suggest in some way that there should or ought to be a connection this is a moral argument not a legal one the pov is not neutral this question comes up in the very opening paragraph of sep entry for legal rights the issue whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of rights principally moral rights we need to talk about what is being inferred here by these two entries being together i too believe the entries need to separated as to link them suggests a direct link between legal and moral rights i do not believe that there is connection although some people think that there should be reason and passion are separate under the law',0

coat of arms of the kingdom of ireland image is dubious the image depicted of the coat of arms of the kingdom of ireland is ahistorical and a creation by its author based on his interpretation of a coat of arms motif that appears on the custom house completed in in dublin while a gold harp on a blue shield with a crown surmounting the shield was sometimes used by the government in ireland the stonework on this building that portrays the shield of ireland in a stylistic way with the supporters for england a lion and scotland a unicorn is simply heraldic artwork and not a proper coat of arms of the said kingdom the kingdom of ireland created by henry viii never had its own unique royal coat of arms ie a full armorial achievement after and the union of the crowns of england and scotland the royal arms of james i of england james vi of scotland did include a harp for ireland in the third quarter the image in question is loosely based on the current uk royal arms it was created by simply placing the shield for ireland as the sole shield and retaining the order of the garter collar st edward is crown supporters and royal motto of the current uk coat of arms which is not in this depiction in its the full armorial achievement format as it is missing the helm crest and compartment it is noteworthy that the creator refers to the crown as the imperial crown which is anachronistic as there was no british empire during the kingdom of ireland period while i think the creator was sincere in thinking this was indeed the historical coat of arms for the kingdom of ireland from until the act of union ireland unlike scotland did not have its own royal coat of arms during this period when the then angloirish parliament met for the last time before the union of it did not request a separate royal coat of arms for use in ireland as scotland did almost a century before in the act of union if anyone has evidence to the contrary i would be most interested to learn about it',0

good information going for the most accurate and complete encyclopedic content possible should we then create a different article for the gong baotian and xie pieqi styles rather than dilute the style information of each style my thought is that we should have a separate article for each subsystem that varies significantly from the norm perhaps one called xie pieqi line yin style baguazhang and another gong baotian line yin style baguazhang for each style with significant amounts of content as well as verifiable sources splits from the main article seem to make sense to me',0

the arbitration comity has absolutly nothing to do with the actual gangs war who is going on in wiki and i demand your immediat removal from the case as completely unable to distinguish on this basic fact you are of no good at all and i certainly do not wish for an arbitration comity to be formed of people who do not have any conscience nor ethic nor sense of duty and who do not even look at the case at hand nor read what the arbitration subject is about before emitting their opinionated evaluations and sentences so rest in peace and might you not be resurected ever btw xal or sophie or whomever you are i usually do not read your rantings i responded to your post above that ended with the sweet let is work together as a team because it did not sound like a rant but this was pointed to me in fact i was blocked for hours along with igor by for rr violation but there is a difference i submitted to the block i did not go unregistered and find another ip to post anyway but igor did not submit to it he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above dear marudubshinki this suggests that igor believes he is above the rules the rr does not apply to him does it this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying table grace before our meal my parents told us all that we had to be reverend bow our heads and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer well i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that bob did not close his eyes for the prayer geee how did he know well it was igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided correctly that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both but since the rules do not apply to igor he went and posted using ip address for instead of logging in to his account anyway it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when snowspinner is tolerance for igor is arrogance hit hisher limit and that is when the excrement really hit the fan for igor rjb or whomever you are i am the alone one ever in wiki on this case both english and french who has posted with her full name and adress and telephon number and private emails twice and referes most of the time with both ip adress and real name even before i had my own registration name on wiki so suck your puppets if cyber leaking make it possible you will soon get a d experience with maharishi maesh yogi ybm dito jean perre voyer dito leuven dito mister rupley replay supra transcendental levitations as the following identical chain of server adress shows returnpath received from mail teliacom mail teliacom by d o dktelianet postfix with esmtp id d e eb for thu sep cest xgreylist domain autowhitelisted by sqlgrey received from smtp wanadoofr smtp wanadoofr by mail teliacom postfix with esmtp id e dd received from mewanadoonet localhost by mwinf wanadoofr smtp server with esmtp id a c a received from loto mixrouen w abowanadoofr by mwinf wanadoofr smtp server with smtp id c c xmeuuid c c mwinf wanadoofr messageid b c b f afd loto from m rupley and a propos transcendental what about this sensational emails content source of ybms facts about the matter sometime i wonder if ph is that far yes this is where ybm seek the truth a propos de laffaire bogdanov je vous recommande \xe2\x80\x94 puisque je suis mis en demeure alors que je nai jamais pris part \xc3\xa0 cette affaire par la folle qui nest pas simone weil \xe2\x80\x94 ces deux liens a story of quotation marks transcendental rational numbers and photoshop en une histoire de guillemets de nombres rationnels \xc2\xab transcendants \xc2\xbb et de photoshop fr o\xc3\xb9 il para\xc3\xaet grande premi\xc3\xa8re dans le monde de l\xc3\xa9dition que l\xc3\xa9diteur des bogdanov utilise photoshop pour produire ses diff\xc3\xa9rentes \xc3\xa9preuves avant impression jai travaill\xc3\xa9 dixhuit',0
as for whether it should be an article i think that they have something like people browsing at the same time as their record and anytime you look there are in the order of people browsing not many members though maybe members online at a time at most are those numbers big enough to warrant an article or are they misleading somehow they also seem to have been responsible for uncovering many wikipedia scandals which have their own wikipedia articles such as the siegenthaler and essjay scandals if there are articles on scandals uncovered by their site then that would seem to me to be enough to justify a site however it seems strange that that is not mentioned in the article is not that the main selling point for the article in both cases there are news references that prove that they are responsible or at least that daniel brandt used the site to uncover the scandals',0

what is control law that seems to be a vague term that could be applied to any law that one does not personally agree with the issue here is gun regulation and the brady scorecard i think just about everyone would agree is an accurate depiction of how extensively firearms are regulated from state to state if the scorecard was indeed arbitrary or advancing an agenda i think you would have a strong point but it is based on a very specific set of objective criteria which is evenly applied from state to state furthermore that criteria can be provided as a citation along with the table to make that clear',0

mecca jmu is reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community as student housing surrounding the university has long been a mecca for underaged drinking many in the community stereotype the students because of this reputation leading to further strain between each group i will not disagree there are harrisonburg residents who are concerned about the relationship between the city and the university but i can not help but think the above statement is overkill the first clause jmu is reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community seems suitable enough to make the point despite being grammatically unstable the second bit it has long been a mecca for underage drinking is inappropriate however mecca is a city in saudi arabia regarded as the holiest meeting site in islam and it is not an accurate literal description of social life around jmu the use of the word mecca in this context could be offensive regardless of any religious affiliation again i acknowledge that there is tension between the community and jmu due in part to excessive partying but still that entire paragraph is based largely on opinion i would appreciate knowing specifically what these community stereotypes are and how they are known hopefully i am doing this right sorry if this seems like a personal attack never done the wikipedia thing',0

i think there is evidence of civility problems the worst offenses were in and it looks like rob was warned perhaps rob has not improved his attitude since then but his handfull of replies to le grand cannot be considered stalking which is a serious offense there are probably afds where one editor made an appearance and the other did not show up there are at least afds where the two editors merely disagreed albeit strongly nope this should just be deleted there is no reason to redirect it it would still be a move list which is not an acceptable article for wikipedia either three times note to closing admin the page that le grand mentions is just an essay and is not a requirement to follow when editing no incident no incident no incident no incident no incident but there are a handful of instances which can be construed as rude leave it be le grand in an edit summary it is pretty clear le grand refuses to agree with game guide policies so he chooses to think the policies do not exist which is disruptive and not helpful to debates on video game weapon lists le grand why are you posting that amazon link more than once people can see the link once it does not need to be posted in two replies this is more proof le grand still does not understand the policies of wikipedia it is not required for people to just drop what they are doing or working on or whatever just to improve an article in deletion you do not need to criticize others just because they do not want to improve the same articles you want to i do not think it is rude to not reply to every comment in afds not everyone has the time to go back to where they posted and reply each and every time assume some good faith instead of thinking people are bad because of minor things rob is clearly not innocent he definitely is not a shining example of good community but he has not sworn at anybody he has not yelled at anybody he has not attacked anybody personally he clearly failed to assume good faith several times and used a rude tone and that is in the broader context of many occasions where the two editors were merely in the same place at the same time which is not surprising for two editors who are active in afds and similar wikiprojects i can not say rob is innocent but i can not stay silent if he is accused of a more egregious wrong stalking rather than a few instances of incivility after being warned in i am not sure if he should be unblocked but make sure the punishment fits the crime',0

yes but the backlog gets horrible in part because half of the pages there are mistagged it is a vicious circle we have there and i understand your view of the criteria but i do not think it is correct because and that is what i said to keegan on your rfa as well admins do not decide whether something is worthy of inclusion a for example is just about whether it may possibly be worthy of inclusion not if they are worthy when you gain adminship you have to remember that your personal views of what is worthy of inclusion and what not are completely irrelevant to your work handling pages where there is doubt there is an arbcom case at the moment because one admin decided to delete pages he deemed unencyclopedic outside policy so carefulness is to be advised in such situations and i am glad you are willing to be more careful after all just cutting away spammy text and making a stub out of a potential g for example does not take up more time than tagging it have a nice day why',0

okay i am going to try and explain this to you again there are a few points which you do not seem to be understanding so i am going to number them infoboxes contain links to various sites which contain information for instance an actor is infobox will often contain a link to their official web site as well as a link to their imdb profile these are not meant as sources or references they are simply links to other reference type sites which are well known for their content as it relates to actors the reason that they are included is summed up on wpel which states in part information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail or other meaningful relevant content imdb and iafd go into a great amount of detail which we do not include this is why they are linked in the infobox imdb much like iafd cannot be used as a source for biographical information this is because there is little if any fact checking done for that information for instance for my imdb profile yes i have one and no i will not share it with you since it has my real name i could supply imdb with a date of birth ethnicity and so on and claim to be me but they do not actually know that i am who i say i am the filmography on my profile though is supplied by the directors production companies etc which have had me work for them on their films filmographies come to imdb from official sources iafd works much the same biographical information is not very well fact checked and comes from the average userreaderwhatever you want to call them filmography info comes from the production companies you keep asking me for a source i do not have any other source than what is already supplied in the article if you go to bitoni is article and look at the ethnicity in the infobox you will see a little number next to it that number refers to a reference in the references section of the article when you look there you will see that all the references are numbered click on the second reference and that is the page that is being used as a reference for her ethnicity the a b c that you see there means that the same source is being used for two other facts within the article that source is from bitoni is publicist it is as credible as can be and is trusted there now that i have explained all of this do you have any questions if so please explain which point you do not understand talk',0
skywriter i have tried to be civil with you i would ask that you return the favor remember i did not even write the old lede i picked that as merely being most likely to be noncontroversial also note that on every single edit page there is a big statement saying if you do not want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others do not submit it part of the edited mercilessly part is that people will criticize your writing it is nothing personal if you see no evidence that kinzer is book brought about a massive reassessment of the coup in iran then you did not read the book or the reviews amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is merely how good one is but whatever you did not include a direct mention in the most recent version so let is just drop this and for about the billionth time since you mention in my edit summary that i am criticizing kinzer i am doing no such thing i am sure the book is very good judging from the review given by the cia history fellow but very good is not the same as an element of crowning importance in the coup itself people knew after that something had gone horribly wrong so this was not a new revelation aggression aside snowfire the underlying flaw in your windy analysis is the absence of credible sourcing you said earlier that your other comments are too general to address if you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording feel free to bring it here for comment i decided to expand on the many problems with the lede and now it is a windy analysis got it but aside from sniping you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing it has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede there are a million and one possible sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede we have to pick which ones i have no doubt that your text was sourced it does not mean it is automatically appropriate for the lede yes and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night fast and loose with facts let me say it again are you denying that cold war paranoia had anything to do with the coup do you realize what references are for it is to confirm facts this fact is obvious and supported by every source including your own so it does not particularly matter what it was referenced to if you want to source it better have a blast but this is not even close to fast and loose with the facts albright is apology you have got a point that the linked nytimes article does not call it apology remember i did not write the old lede fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we would like the cia does cite vague fear of the soviet union in its most recent justification for the coup however the cia is accounting published in three years after the publication of kinzer is pathbreaking book must be weighed against the cia is destruction of most of its documents related to this coup wait the cia destroyed the documents so therefore the soviet union had nothing to do with it that logic does not flow more to the point the idea that cold war machinations were behind the us involvement is in literally every source i have not read all the shah is men but from your linked book review the one by a notable person not from amazon reviewers it seems to be in that too i quote eisenhower and his secretary of state john foster dulles were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by moscow is machinations kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic john foster and a cynical allen by ignoring the anticommunist basis of us policy he wrenched the dispute with the aioc out of its cold war context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint lastly mossadeq is na\xc3\xafvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the tudeh party is efforts to penetrate and control iranian institutions he seemed almost blithely unaware that prosoviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of eastern europe by not reining in iran is communists he fell on washington is enemies list httpswwwciagovlibrarycenterforthestudyofintelligencecsipublicationscsistudiesstudiesvol no article html yeah as a reminder this is from a review of your favored source also note that dulles is described as moralistic ie interested in stopping the communists not greedy interested in oil squares with what i know of dulles anyway the overwhelming consensus is that the us was invol',0

what i am getting at is that speedy is the only person who was ever really in dispute about the mentionability of mario kart in the sonic r article please remember that while i have shown disagreement with calling the game a kart racer rather then a mascotbased racing game i never actually said the comparison did not belong there entirely and while the sources certainly touch on the connection between mario kart and sonic r albeit briefly and serve well enough to push speedy is proverbial nose in the facts they only serve that particular purpose as no one else really needed the proof to begin with making the links on that page feel in my humble opinion like cluttering up the page with unneeded external linkage in this case citing sources to prove mario kart is notability in comparison to sonic r could just as well have been done in relative privacy on the talk page without cluttering up the main article again in my opinion at least',0

proposal for a revised introduction okay i have a proposal for a new intro which needs to be worked on more but i wanted to put what i have so far out there i am not at all wild about the specific wording at points but i think you will get the drift the intro has been the victim of a lot of reversions and i think it would be good for us to get that straight right now there is no criticism of chomsky is position on nicaragua v united states in the intro actually ultramarine appears to have added it back but i have a different version and i think there obviously should be i have also added some new stuff here it is and i will try to explain what i was trying to do and what i think is missing after the proposed text the first two sentences are the same including sources though i have removed some italics which seemed unnecessary the united states of america has been accused of funding training and harboring individuals and groups who engage in terrorism by some legal scholars other governments and human rights organizations among others linguist and us foreign policy critic noam chomsky argues that the us has been legally found guilty of international terrorism based on the verdict by the international court of justice in nicaragua v united states which condemned the united states federal government not for terrorism per se but for its unlawful use of forcecite web urlhttpwwwzmagorgcontentforeignpolicychomskyglobete',0

furthermore previous declination stated edit warring is forbidden whether or not it occurs in the enforcement of any real or perceived consensus let alone a majority approval because wikipedia does not operate by majority rule but despite my question how is it edit warring to implement a version that has approval of a majority pending revision only after further discussion i have received no answer to that simple question also contrary to this denial wpconsensus in fact states all editors are expected to make a goodfaith effort to reach a consensus that is aligned with wikipedia is principles sometimes voluntary agreement of all interested editors proves impossible to achieve and a majority decision must be taken anyone can see on the talk page i have made an extraordinary goodfaith effort to reach a consensus on the wording of the rd para a full consensus could not be reached but a majority decision was taken that decision was to implement the wording in question pending discussion and review that is a perfectly reasonable solution it further was agreed only after objectionssuggestions have been heard and received peer approval should changes be made there are a number of rogue editors who have rejected this solution preferring instead to edit war editing the para without explanation or discussion it is therefore those who defy wikipedia policy on conflict resolution who are responsible for edit warring',0

international sos revisited if you cannot source your edits they do not satisy our content policies good faith can be questioned when facts especially regarding a commercial organisation which you appear to be involved with are continually reincluded without sources and as you admit you were involved in this deal it would appear you have a conflict of interest i know you are extremely keen to have this little nugget of information included in wikipedia but you have to do it by the rules if you are claiming that unsourced facts in wikipedia should be allowed because you can just ring someone up and ask you have got it wrong and if you are referring to the warning above as false it forms part of wikipedia is warning template structure hence any discussion about its validity should be brought up at an appropriate talkpage talk',0
some personal observations here put a summary of it into the roots of christianity perhaps a whole subsection thereof if the zoroastrianism part is included then so must the egyptian especially since the hebrews were long associated with egypt back to the hyksos invasion it would be pov to disclude this factor considering the trail of monotheism left by akhenaten and adopted by the hebrews i myself do not know much about zoroaster but i certainly recognise much of the egyptian issue and i am more of a casual researcher it seems to me that zoroastrian elements are tied to the persian background but it would be prejudiced to say that the egyptians have no basis when they long dominated palestine the greek pharaoh himself patroned the septuagint in alexandria i find the bigotry towards an egyptian root of christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race that the hamites of africa have not contributed anything and that the persians supposedly wereare white or considered japhethic as opposed to the semites seriously this noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these afroasiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less white than the greeks and romans i consider persians to be semites because they are asian in this context give it as much credence as the persian foundations and you will make this npov i seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of christianity and also delineating the greek root which provided roman impetus for adoption and proliferation for instance if the greeks had not patroned that religious culture as their relation to philistines rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with greece rome even rebuilt greek philistia as palestine and during the catholic crusades it became the kingdom of jerusalem christianity has so many dimensions that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from europe and buddhist ties in southwest asia i myself used to be atheist or odinist not wanting to deal with what i percieved to be other peoples culture and now i look in wonder at the historical background of the sea peoples and the subsequent graecoroman expansion in the mediterranean sea there are european roots throughout the region now considered islamic or arab but if we do not provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the library of alexandria just think of the term indoeuropean and you will understand alexander the great is empire see the connection between the european fylfot and indian swastika or the cross and the ankh please do not demolish this magnificent research for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things i am only stating things as i commonly have studied and heard of them i do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue therefore i am not endorsing pov the various sources i have seen via google search appear legitimate andor sometimes biasedas anything but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic we are not to cast a pov on the issue in favour or against just to deliver as any messenger does the existing article on the history of christianity provides the persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the egyptian or hellenic origins which are quite prominent after all christianity had most of its evolution in nonpersian areas of the mediterranean sea tell me how many persian people are prominent in the christian world throughout its history what fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of persian elements in christianity compared to the vast amount of greek specialtyas written verified and generally known amongst the entire christian populace and the nursery of christianity itself in egypt via the old testamenteven jesus is infancy was spent in egypt in safety from herod please where is the background of christianity in persia besides th century racial studies like i have said the noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for indoaryan racist theories feb utc',0

the problem precisely is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure noun is raining object then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless i e a dummy word if the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is then by definition it is not a dummy pronoun my contention is that maybe the verb is really impersonal i e its subject is truly a dummy word not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot the definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately i know it just covers what i think are the features of what linguists call dummy pronoun based on my amateur experience on the matter i know it is not completely wrong or misleading though it probably needs a different form the glossary definition above otoh is a bit too vague but in any case note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in it is raining',0

i mentioned this to thequackdaddy as well but i thought it might be helpful to address you as well your recent claims on the blagojevich page have a few things that make me curious press releases are public domain with information and numbers verified by the state desgined for public use and in the case of much of the media often copying verbatim simply put there is no copyright when it comes to press releases issued by an office the links are provided right underneath each section not even consigned to the notes section so what is the exact rule the credit is fully given furthermore your and thequackdaddy is consistent monitoring of this page to remove postive elements but to protect underreferenced and biased negative content on this page has me very curious to who would spend so much energy doing so you have stated that this section should not be a soapbox what do you call the more blantantly biased negative postings on this page it seems no one has a problem with information or the rules if the information is negative i would appreciate a response and a more thorough explanation of what exact rules are being broken for now i will edit the information i am trying to include and continue to repost',0

sandahl is of questionable ethnicity and i have an opinion that possibly his actions are motivated by ethnic or racial bias i am the legendary danny o wouldoul and this mysterious sandahl has removed my article for being patently nonsense and then has the nerve to tell me not to take it personally i guess that sandahl does not believe that a performer dedicated to both charitable good works and promoting teenage sobriety is patently nonsensical but i am beginnning to wonder if this character sandahl is an antiamerican anarchist or worse a possible enemy of our great nation',0

comment it would have been helpful to provide links to the sources sited also it is not necessary to provide intext mention of sources of facts words in scare quotes should not be used in headings since they raise the question of who is using the term comparing the text with a summary provided by the csm i find a few apparent inaccuracies in the text the irs did not flag the groups for review of their taxexempt status instead they flagged new applications for taxexempt status for new tea party groups formed in the runup to the election groups whose main activity is support of political candidates and parties are ineligible for taxexempt status the csm does not say that asking for donor lists is a violation of irs policy just that it is not typically required i do not see either the need to quote so many people just citing republican and tea party sources makes it appear that they are the only ones who hold that opinion why not just summarize the general reaction to the story that the irs has abused its power by failing to be nonpolitical nonpartisan and neutral',0

very interesting comments about the purpose and setting of the painting the brushstrokes from this period are very developed and bold the vivid colors within the colors add depth and meaning the flowing lines of the pathway are reminiscent of a river which would support the theory that this is more of an ode to the sense of impending death the cypress not only divides the sky from the symbols of old and new it also divides the land on the left is the field ripe with a crop ready for harvest the motion of the travelers is forward and to the right it is like they are moving forward towards the future even though behind them is the overwhelming forces of nature and fate',0

prof rachel baskerville\xc2\xb4s capital maintenance contribution prof baskerville you are not allowed on wikipedia to qoute yourself it is called conflict of interest this is a wikipedia policy i may quote or add comments from your excellent work to wikipedia but you cannot do it yourself your contribution which is a direct quote from your ssrn publication is also not encyclopedic as they say over here on wikipedia i also disagree with what you are stating we can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on wikipedia i appreciate that you are new on wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic herewith then the contribution from prof baskerville that i removed from the article this the iasb framework describes as above how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways firstly \xe2\x80\x9ca financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements under a financial concept of capital such as invested money or invested purchasing power capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity\xe2\x80\x9d so most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance secondly you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance eg is the capacity of the waterworks waste water system etc in the local town the same as or better than it was last year some key performance indicators kpis will be chosen to report this the framework states \xe2\x80\x9cunder a physical concept of capital such as operating capability capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on for example units of output per day\xe2\x80\x9d these are two \xe2\x80\x98concepts of capital\xe2\x80\x99 thirdly and this is confusing a legal meaning in the uk arose as follows english law developed the \xe2\x80\x98doctrine of capital maintenance\xe2\x80\x99 with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends the \xe2\x80\x98doctrine of capital maintenance\xe2\x80\x99 underpins the legal rules addressing tabpayment of dividends to shareholders tabreduction of a company\xe2\x80\x99s share capital or reserves taba company\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of its own shares and other aspects from october private companies in the uk will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court so when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third conceptbaskerville rachel f questions and answers about ifrs january available from ssrn httpssrncomabstract i will still add my points of disagreement with prof baskervilles contribution',0

hello walter following the wqa opened by the above editor i have determined that he is in the bad habit of rattling cages quite often some people he has had frictions with in the mere days since he opened his account include and seems to be a regular pattern of accusing people of stalking harassment and personal attacks but does not appear to present himself in a particularly civil manner from what i gather the fact that he has opened up a dialogue with you commencing with a rather aggressive who the hell are you seems to suggest that this guy is adversarial the wqa shows he is not always willing to accept the truth either i suspect that erikeltic is also unwilling to drop the stick in terms of the spi jake matter as he too is still pursuing admin advice fraught in seeing cowboy blocked it would seem needless to say this is just some friendly advice that djathinkimacowboy seems a bit of a mudslinger so you might want to watch him carefully in future especially since you opposed his canvassing claims in the spi and his reaction is to treat everyone against him like a group conspiracy then starts taking to several talk pages which becomes harder to follow take care cheers \xc2\xa0chat\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xa0rff',0

moving deep ellum hi and thanks for you work on the dallas texas neighborhoods i do disagree with your move of deep ellum to deep ellum dallas texas both because a google search seems to turn up no other deep ellums in the world thus there is no need for the more complex title and because the cutandpaste move eliminates the page history which is sketchy because our license the gfdl requires it the appropriate thing to do when trying to move a page to an already existing location is to request a move at wikipediarequested moves a week or so after listing there an administrator sees if there is consensus on the article is talk page to move and then in this case would swap redirect and article locations with page history talk page and all what i am going to do is place a on both articles and list it at wprm so an administrator can fix it at whichever location is decided by consensus talk',0

ban the reality of the matter is that every time varsovian returned to wikipedia he inserted himself invented a new dispute you accuse me of nationalistic persistent povpushing pursuit where exactly have i done that eh what a joke you just made that up to justify your ban jaroslaw bilaniuk jakiw palij and bohdan koziy are simply not poles if somebody tries to add the category polish nazi collaborator then he is simply trying to insert untrue information which needs to be removed it is as simple as that did you care to check if there are any sources calling these guys polish nazi collaborators or is that falls outside your intellectual capabilities how is removing wrong information persistent povpushing pursuit i am a member of wiki projects i worked on many different topic areas and improved countless pages i have created new articles and a couple dyks as well and what exactly has varsovian contributed to wikipedia apart from constantly creating disputes on polish topics are you able to name one single page on which varsovian did some substantial work worthy of mention in one year of activity on wikipedia i do not ask or pages but one single page your systematic attempts at trying to equal me with varsovian are both shameful and disgraceful but i am not surprised one can easily guess the morals of a person who blocked me for hours after i simply and politely asked if i am allowed to do something or person who first refuses to do ae because there is lack of transparency and a problem with notification good one that one and then comes back a couple of hours later to do a revenge ae nobody requested and miraculously the transparency which just a couple of hours earlier was this big problem is all of a sudden no problem at all',0

it is a college town and to my knowledge there is nothing there that would make it a wartime target knowning that lawrence was hit changes a lot though before gray is report i think the general assumption was that only the real big cities were hit if lawrence was hit though that means a hundred other smaller cities across the us could also have been targets not to launch into too much speculation here but that opens up some interesting possibilities if the people of jericho could see a mushroom cloud over denver then they would surely see one over colorado springs the home of norad and pueblo wichita which is about as far from jericho as denver is might also have been a target since its population is more than three times that of lawrence as has been mentioned before denver is not visible from western colorado nor are there any real mountains anywhere in the vicinity if the bad guys unleashed tsar bomba upon the city of denver then maybe but gray said the nyc bomb they intercepted was only kilotons a possible answer to this is that the mushroom cloud seen in the first episode could have been over one of the smaller cities closer to the kansas border say limon or sterling there are no towns between denver and kansas that have a population of more than fifty or sixty thousand but if lawrence was hit it seems like those in jericho would be able to visually estimate the distance though so i am more inclined to chalk it up to hey it is just a tv show but it does remind us that the people of jericho and we at home do not know anything for sure which is one thing that seems pretty realistically done in the show and i was going to say something about the day after as well but beat me to it must type faster \xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x9c\x86\xe2\x9c\x8d\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\xba',0

the ordering was made to make it easier to find the places on the map not because of any progression of civilization i personally would prefer alphabetical sorting for the names of placemarks i prefer the ancient names since this is an article about ancient sites with alternative names and modern names given in parentheses which cities in the list have not been located i will change location uncertain to inexact coordinates to reflect that onlymy coordinates are not exact as i prefer and not the location of the site as such is uncertain eg kish is somewhere in the vicinity of the given coordinates but not in the exact spot but i am continuously refining the coordinates',0

honestly i would be tempted to remove those too now there may be exceptions as there surely are but in most cases a forum discussion will not meet the criteria for a good external link it is an interesting debate to be sure but for a start it might look entirely different a year from now secondly there is nothing really provable to say these people are more expert on the matter than say my friends over at the return to castle wolfenstein forum as for the silver star text i am hoping to find time to look over the article again in detail soon and that is one of the things i may replace with the simple external link or at the very least condense best regards \xc5\xa3 \xc3\xa7',0

october utc well paul perhaps you should follow your own words if you claim to like to work with eman to improve the san francisco article but find it hard to do so in a adversarial environment for starters the record shows from the original discussion back from back in december there was no consensus reached and none for months its only when i added a photo a few months ago when you only recently as last acted arbitrarily on your own and changed the picture based on one approval from an unregistered user quoting your words and see what happens did you reach a consensus the last time i checked and especially according to the rules a wikipedia consensus has to have more than just two users ie you and one other person just because you have spent the most time working on this article does not make it your own and give you the ability to arbitrarily make decisions and changes to it as i have seen you do for countless other edits on this page as i mentioned i am going to call in an admin to settle this fairly since it does not seem you want to do so on your end this is wikipedia not your own personal page andor blog',0
topic ban relating to and let me be honest i am not up for a protracted debate i am just here to offer a perspective that you are free to ignore the problem is how you phrased the issue if you are claiming admin abuse you need to be specific if you are claiming it is no longer needed then your opinion of pbs is original ban is irrelevant when it comes to general sanctions admin are given broad and sweeping authority because the community wanted them to have a hammer to deal with problems whether you deserved it or not i have no idea i did not do that research and do not have time i am talking about procedure here kosh is comments just muddied the waters unquestionably admin have the authority to do moratoriums and the like on these articles under general sanctions and do topic bans authority is not debatable because it is clearly spelled out in policy so kosh ended up making it less likely others would participate when debating something that is clearly not debatable and pbs was on topic in addressing those points your points got lost in the mix it happens and dougweller and rgloucester also piped in it was not just one person it was just one person taking your side but he was mistaken on the procedural points even dgg jumped in to support the moratorium and he is not prone to jump into fires then obsidi joined the fray so people participated besides yourself not just one the problem being that you guys debated the right of the admin to impose sanctions and he clearly has the right instead of the circumstances of your situation which is why of the people disagreed with you and kosh you complain that only one admin has spoken but that is not true obviously pbs is an admin but so is dougweller and dgg neither of which has a reputation for being heavy handed quite the opposite actually in reality he could have put a one year moratorium on name changes and it would have been supported in policy but he chose a very short and reasonable period you might not like it but the community voted specifically to give admin that power if you had not muddied the discussion up by mixing both issues your topic ban and his authority to issue a moratorium you would have had a better chance although odds are that the topic ban would have stuck because there was not any abuse in his doing so that i could see it was his judgement disagreeing with it does not make it abuse and the fact that it was only three monthsthat is the shortest topic ban i have ever seen so obviously he was not trying to be heavy handed sometimes you just have to accept that you do not have a case and this one could easily be closed as no consensus to make any changes to existing sanctions again i am not up for debating but i could care less about these articles and if you want an honest review from an experienced admin you just read it \xc2\xa2',0

reasons why greece is acting like this one of the main rights of humans as well as countries is the right to freely choose its name one of the biggest insults for me is when somebody is trying to change the name of another one this time i will not respond to the insults posted by usermakedonas usernestore and uservergina because the language they are using is unacceptable for a serious site like wikipedia just to quote the last comment by usermakedonas this is a country which was a part of jugoslaviawhere a lot of people are albanianswhere they speak a bulgarian dialektand they want to have a greek name for me it is very difficult to understand the offensive position of greeks trying to change the name of its neighboring country so i will try to dig in the history and in the recent events in order to find an answer why greece is doing this history undisputable fact is that modern greeks have very little common with the ancient macedonians even with the ancient greeks actually all modern nations living in the balkan peninsula are modern nations created with mixing the old nations like ancient greeks ancient macedonians ilirs etc with the modern greeks slavic population etc for example the most dominant opinion in our country is that the modern macedonian nation is created as mixture of ancient macedonians and slavic population probably the modern greek nation has origin from the ancient greeks and ancient macedonians but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a right to claim ownership of the name macedonia another interesting fact is that the name macedonia was virtually forbidden for use in greece before seventies in the last century actually the northern part of greece was called \xe2\x80\x9cnorthern greece\xe2\x80\x9d meantime greeks realized that they can benefit more if they adopt the name of macedonia starting from that point the northern part of greece was renamed to macedonia and many shops airports streets etc got the macedonian name so greece is using the name macedonia for its northern part for years but republic of macedonia is using its name officially from that is years one of the biggest fears of greece is its macedonian minority it is known that a large population of greece claim macedonian ethnicity actually during the civil war in greece from a real genocide of the macedonian population took place there many of the macedonian people were tortured and expelled from their homes nowadays greece doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the macedonian minority and forbids the use of macedonian language culture education etc very interesting fact is the following luxembourg and belgium are neighboring countries belgium has a province which is called luxembourg so far belgium never disputed that in our situation greece has a province called macedonia but aggressively disputes the right of our country to use its name greece claims that macedonia has pretensions over greek territories even if that is true greece is several times stronger than macedonia economically politically military etc so it is really hard to believe that macedonia can harm greece especially by using the name macedonia',0

blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse race and intelligence explanationsspearman is hypothesis iq tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents the mean blackwhite difference varies considerably across tests with different contents for example the bw gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order across a large number of test the standardized mean blackwhite gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation according to this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean wb difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests the gbased factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities correlations between an iq subtest is gloading and the magnitude of the blackwhiteeast asian score gap for that subtest pp pp for example the blackwhite gap is greater on backward digits span a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given and the more gloaded test than forward digits span a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given and the less gloaded test as predicted by spearman is hypothesis the bw gap is largest on the most gloaded tests narrowing of the bw gap has been seen mostly on less gloaded tests such as literacy tests murray c the inequality taboo commentary magazine september arthur jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the blackwhite gap for example past history of slavery discrimination caste status peer pressure against acting white etc have an effect on g p the author of multiple factor analysis l l thurstone warned we must guard against the simple but common error of merely taking a first centroid factor a first principal component or other mean factor in a test battery and then calling it a general factor spearman is g then is a statistical artifact c loring brace the gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given and the more gloaded test iq tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence this is obviously original research but i cannot find no sources that supports my argument even though i am not black',0

when you saved the logo from the official site you probably saved the file as doopjpg since that is what the site calls it the jpg extension is a good indication that the image is in the jpeg format if you do not see file extensions on your computer windows xp hides them by default you can always rightclick on any image on a web page and select properties or something similar there should be a field in the properties window called location or address or the like that will show you the url of the image which is httpwwwdooporgimgdoopjpg as before the jpg extension is a good indicator that the image is a jpeg so that original image is already compressed as a jpeg and it will already have compression artifacts but that site does not seem to be an official futurama site it seems to be a fan site unrelated to fox or any of its affiliates so it is possible that there is an official fox page that will have a png version of the doop logo more likely you will find a gif version which can be losslessly converted to a png but you will have to do some searching \xe2\x80\x94',0

the first image turkish cypriots in britain is inappropriate and features turkish nationalists carrying flags of turkey and the turkish occupation regime and not one sight of a flag of the internationally recognised republic of cyprus in a provocative antigreek cypriot rally in support of the illegal turkish occupation of cyprus the image also violates the rules on use of national flags in articles about ethnic minorities living in another country',0

not balanced way too negative i think this article is much too negative and a smear campaign against bp as a company bp has a fine record and is much safer than many others oil spills happen it is inevitable this fear mongering does nothing and seems designed to fit the lib and msm agenda of preventing american energey indepenance by making it illegul to drill in alaska where there is oil if you dont like it fine but no need to sensationalize some relatively minor event as if it were a gigantic asteroid about to kill million people this article is a sad and cynical exercise in yellow journalism to improve it there needs to be more info about the process of oil extraction the frequency of oil spills bps technological advances and fine safety record and the need of oil to make the american economy run without giving money to terrorists there needs to be an effort to establish the context of this so that it is not turned into some political demlib point scoring stuff',0

we have been through all this before the fact that other articles treat their subject in a particular way is not a reason for changing this one which is in accordance with wikipedia policies any alleged shortcomings of the ayurveda article should be taken up at talkayurveda the claim that the article almost just covers the scientific validity is something of an exaggeration the sections on medical and scientific analysis do not make up rd of the sections they make up subsections of text out of and at a rough count and excluding the lead comprise around words out of a total of over and are preceded by the sections describing homoeopathy the allegation that the article is a result of some sort of plot by allopathy is not a valid criticism of the article and fails to assume good faith and the answer to your question is that the article is about both you may consider the issue of whether or not it actually works to be unimportant but i put it to you that most rational people would consider this to be the most important thing about any system of medicine',0

antiserb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization obviously it will be poorly sourced just as list of massacres in the kosovo war is a wp creation we find a subject then we link sourcesstories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon the fact is that serbophobia as a concept is not a myth but it is confined to the nation is sympathizers and is rejected by the nation is detractors obviously serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than antiserb sentiment in that implies an outright hatred naturally no serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in croatia krajina and eatern bosnia during the yugoslav wars seeing a westbrokered peace deal in putting at end to bosniakcroat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not avnoj entities and then a few years later support the uck in kosovo pushing from the first moment to have fry forces expelled succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize kosovo no avnoj argument there but it does not end there kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from us recognition to welcoming of independence from organizations such as the basque authority in spain all entitled to their own opinions but serbs who claim serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events you do not get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia nor many other wouldbe states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor in the eyes of locals these feats give serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment you are not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavyhanded s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall that said savich and trifkovic are fine sources people just do not like them because their ethnicity socalled overrules their wisdom',0

on the goodness of description and evil of prescription the article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked linguists are said to be concerned normally with the former implying that there is something abnormal about the latter the notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate when seeking such help and when making such decisions ourselves is not only perverse and deplorable but also patently wrong we begin our lives incapable of speech is it wrong to acquire the ability is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes motivated i suspect by timidity laziness irresponsibility and ignorance only a stubborn intentional dedicated ignorance can maintain that proficiency in english composition must not be taught nor properly called grammar',0

i read the comment differently that you apparently and that is read in the present tense also as someone who is part of the lgbt community and has been intimately aware of aids and those with it since the early s i can tell you that resentment is not really accurate look i have known more than friends who have died from the disease at least of them dying in the s the remainder in the early to mid s before the drugs got better and more effective over the longterm there was a time when i was attending multiple funerals every month i still know a good number of men who remain hiv positive but have somehow stayed alive with the disease for more than two decades i can testify as a first handwitness that it was not resentment people in the gay community were feeling it was anger and certainly not because of ryan white is openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease the anger was directed largely at the us government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die died because of who they were and were being punished ryan white and elizabeth glaser put a new face to aids most certainly but i know of no one in the gay community and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community i think i would have a better perspective than someone who is not no matter how close they think they arewere to those in the queer world who felt resentment over the attention aids received after their aids diagnoses became public knowledge if anything the gay community and those with hivaids within the gay community were elated that something was now going to be done while skeptical it might be shortlived andor selective yet still quite angry that when it was a gay disease it was not important enough for the potus to acknowledge',0

on makemi\xe2\x80\x99s previous comment makemi said i am not clear on how this is revolutionary it seems like a biggerfasterlouder computer piano i deleted the remark on the ceus being a milestone i even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise despite the fact that even the praises i made were based on facts on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano so here is the current article that i have incorporating the recent change i made following makemi\xe2\x80\x99s feedback any praise of any kind has been deleted by me even though my praises were based on facts on knowledge the new b\xc3\xb6sendorfer reproducing grand piano the ceus computer grand piano pianos that has for goal of accomplishing full expressiveness at the keyboard during the past recent decades a reproducing piano also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces the touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano however a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it usually it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard many digital sounds are available piano harpsichord organ strings etc it also has a midi interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular midi format however the midi format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of scales or steps if you prefer the problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed making these scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers the capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard consequently a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the midi format in summary a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old an acoustic piano with the new a midi format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano at the same time it allows the pianist to play the numerous midi piano pieces available but more importantly to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the midi format the quality of the b\xc3\xb6sendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making b\xc3\xb6sendorfer also kept in touch with modernity they took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their se computer piano that was made in collaboration with wayne stahnke it was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time at the beginning of b\xc3\xb6sendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos the ceus computer grand piano previously to the b\xc3\xb6sendorfer ceus computer grand piano several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be these studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos including the se computer piano were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been see in particular measurement and reproduction accuracy of computercontrolled grand pianos by werner goebl et al august taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano the se computer piano b\xc3\xb6sendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish the very challenging goal of being able to record and playback the full gamut of expressivene',0

what you are missing is that we simply do not use compound nationalities because they are read differently by different speakers of english british vs american vs australian etc canadian american is ambiguous in some forms of english it means an americanborn person with canadian ancestry which is not accurate therefore we use the nationality held at the time the subject became notable in the lead sentence and mention any addition nationalities in separate sentences the problem is the ambiguity of the compound term not all readers understand the same meaning you are attempting to convey this make the article inaccurate for a subset of readers just do not use a compound term',0

it is true that lots of more modern arts hang without frames but the signac paintings are years old and even contemporary art in a wikipedia article benefits from frames in their presentation to the viewer virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the usually rectangular image this is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase the scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration we have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article if we are going to argue that wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail then why bother including images of famous paintings at all i think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way therefore it seems like a poor move to reduce their usefulness to the reader by removing the framing lines and the emphasis those lines impart to the image',0
i would also like to prove that cfred is biased in his decisions in that he cites this was a personal attack on the personal attack page it does not say in the subsection what is considered to be a personal attack anything regarding close variants of a name or anything of that matter however it does say accusations about personal behavior that lack evidence serious accusations require serious evidence evidence often takes the form of diffs and links presented on wiki sometimes evidence is kept private and made available to trusted users how can you accuse someone of harrassment or a personal attack when the act in question is not documented in the criteria of what is considered to be a personal attack yet say i am making a personal attack do you see me making any legal threats making fun of your race threatening to reveal something private of yours no you abused your powers and it was not nice i did nothing wrong except for being new to the wikipedia world and deciding to learn on the fly rather than reading every little detail whereas cfred is a veteran of the wikipedia world and should know these rules and regulations',0

hi there when you create an article on wikipedia you have to provide reliable thirdparty sources to show why it is notable for inclusion the article is nice but there is nothing from a thirdparty saying why this particular company meets the wikipedia guidelines for inclusion sources such as newspapers books etc are considered reliable sources if you include some of these to back up the assertions made in the article it should be ok assuming there are any which is where again the notability aspect comes in you might want to start here httpnewsgooglecomarchivesearchhlentabwnnedusq donlencorporation ieutf as a suggestion best regards talk',0

stanzegel writes to ctswyneken an anonymous editor is like a sniper in a tree top taking pot shots at those trying to do serious work on the ground and dropping his waste matter into the work in progress i am not sure that anything such a person attempts to add is worth verifying but should be summarily deleted on the basis that a responsible person would identify himself if the material is truly worthy a responsible scholar will get around to adding it in the present case i believe we are dealing with a sock puppet for an editor who has been banned previously for similar activity and may be on probation right now if so that probation is being violated and keeping his edits or wasting time on his contributions simply enables continuing violations talk',0

i have read this and about the only thing i can pick up on that you may not like is unveirifable information which i content under the rule photos are neutral another reason perhaps wanting to limit amount of links on page however links is not excessive surely perhaps the most likely reason is that i posted the link myself for a website i own can it be verified who posted the link for derilictecouk then the users have blocked their details from inspection with nominet so it could well be posted by a user who edits the raf rudloe manor pages if we discover who runs this site and they are on the rudloe manor page should this be deleted also thank you rklawton user verbal chose on another page crop circles to delete my link to my website there also however verbal did not bother to check the other links some of which link to conetnt which requires plugin software to be installed this is discouraged by wiki policy external links but for some reason verbal chose to only take a keen interest in removing my link and not bothering checking anything else or doing any other work i find this odd and verbal has followed me on to this page to decry my links the words witch hunt come to mind can you please explain what reasons you feel apply to why the links need to be removed if it would make you happier i could easily provide another wesbite which is not owned by myself but uses my aerial photos of rudloe manor after all derlicte does not have such aerial photography and only covers site of the base pointing to the policy page does not address the many points i have made re some users being able to post personal photos directly to wiki but myself not even being allowed to make a link to photos if i were to upload my photos of rudloe manor directly to wiki how many miliseconds would it take before editors removed them just because its me i draw your attention to a gallery of pictures some of which are even classified unidentified bird pictures and this is seen as perectly fine i feel obligated to do this considering my own issues being looked into i consider this type of gallery to be exactly the type of thing i would not be allowed to do these sorts of galleries should be on a users own flicker pages or personal website and not to use wiki space for personal advertising or gratification which is directly what i seem to be being told i cannot do',0

comment it is confusing enough that i am not sure what disagree means in this conversation a quick run through my sources indicates that folk costume folk dress national dress ethnic costume traditonal dress etc are all used pretty much interchangeably i would support a move to folk costume or folk dress for the reasons cited above but folk costume should not be a subset of national dress since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified at least in europe as mentioned some folk dress is still evolving for what it is worth i would not characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of th century clothing and bolo ties are a modern invention but bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress by the way the use of narrow use costume to mean theatrical costume is about as common as the use of dress to mean a woman is garment with a skirt both costume and dress have these narrow nonspecialist everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of wikipedia clothing is probably the most neutral and inclusive term but we struggle in choosing medieval clothing vs medieval costume vs medieval dress and folk clothing is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb in the museum and arthistorical worlds costume and dress are both preferred terms oed definitions are pertinent here costume the mode or fashion of personal attire and dress including the way of wearing the hair style of clothing and personal adornment belonging to a particular nation class or period dress personal attire or apparel orig that proper to some special rank or order of person or to some ceremony or function but in later use often merely clothing costume garb esp that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering is right in that there is not a simple solution we are going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go gievn the oed definitions i would say folk costume is more accurate but i personally prefer folk dress and i would choose that over national dress',0

there is no good hand bad hand here that is a total misuse of that concept another attempt to smear me with no grounds whatsoever this is not an alternate persona this is me talking the way i talk trying to resolve an issue with another user the way i would do normally a user i have no prior conflict with or any intention of alarming or harassing in this case however for sound common sense reasons that you two would do well not to feign ignorance of given neither of you are new admins i just do not happen to want to make my other contributions available to all and sundry just because i happened to have decided to try and do that errantx if you want to continue to smear my actions in the most despicable way by trying to paint what were civil polite queries as a pursuit and you want to continue to insult me by insinuating i am a coward then i guess there is nothing i can do stop you given you have been entrusted with the power to do so but i will take the fact that neither of you are prepared to detail what part of wpsock i have actually violated or indeed identify which part of wpharass i am supposedly guilty of as evidence that you can not not to mention neither of you seem prepared to present any evidence that malleus himself felt threatened or alarmed by the conversation or had asked me to leave and i had refused to do so i guess you two can live with that i suppose but mark my words if or when there is an arbitration case concerning malleus conduct then i will be entering this experience into evidence and adding usererrantx and userbwilkins as admin parties to it with questions to answer as to why they chose to block off an attempt at civil discourse with the user who neither requested the communication to stop or said he felt threatened or harassed by it in any way i did have half a mind to try and continue the conversation here if malleus was willing given that there is some simple concluding statements that arise from it that i would have liked to have seen whether he was happy to sign off on or not but i get the sense that you two would probably block talk page access for some spurious reason whether he was interested in doing so or not i sincerely hope there is nothing deeper than simple admin overreaching going on here but precedent says otherwise with these types of disputes i am sadly reminded by your actions of several other cases which ended up at arbitration simply because people were unwilling to follow some basic steps like agf indeed the steps outlined in policy so you just content yourselves that you have done something good here and i will just get back to my main account and do my thing there and we will see what the future holds for all of us happy trails',0

how foolish of us not to think that man be must be braindead not to realize this of course charlie is pa stole the land everybody should ignore the fact that it is in the nature of an empire to go and conquer everything they can of course it is wrong to steal back that land of corse the empire has all the rights to take ie not steal just annex colonize brainwash tax aso to land initially they have the army to come and take any land they feel like of course if the empire is weakened for years because of a peasant revolution it is wrong to steal back that land come on who are charlie is pa to steal back from that empire and who are they to even listen to what they have to say an empire is an empire and as long as they have a big enough big bloody army to it in the east of charlie is land there is absolutly no point to argue agains otherwise people will come and say charlie is pa stole the land from us but we never stole it in the first place because we do not have an expansionist and ignorant attitude about tiny charlies irony',1

from someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now and i contributed a lot in a short time and would have contributed so much more had i continued things that i did huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free placed pd on subjects often providing the only pics to this day on the subjects in question hundreds of pages formatted according to standards huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it etc etc and instead of helping me and being civil sensible and using common sense you were more interested in defending a noncontributing user who for no apparent reason started a campaign of open violent threats death threats spamming and vandalism on me you were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation by modvandalizing discussions on the subject etc against most other moderators private views even they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject your page nerdopedia rulebook and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you apparently you felt that since you had read it everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who did not with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it no regard for that individuals contributions no regard for civility and most of all with no common sense applied whatsoever it is indeed too bad that most pages on nerdopedia are starting to be shockingy unmaintained and obsolete indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years and the fun is over for most people as the most brutal blow of all moderators such as you have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave they simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here because of people like you and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here it is all about brownnosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more ocd nerds who are already admins and you are just a wannabe good ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top whatever pop bands may be popular at the time the latest tv show pages and some other obsessivecompulsive nerdishm nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job from people such as you for example the pages on my subjects were very active till late and since that they have well remained in the same form as the core contributors left them as they left this site no updates i am truly not the only one to eject not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over if you ever need any help it is kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too but given your attitude back then i am not surprised you did after all there were some decent admins here back then such as and i am sure there is a few now but way too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives and they have to show it and snoop their noses everywhere but like i said as even admins are dropping out what do you think happened to the contributors many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details and newbies or worse malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant admins will be happy to see updates to the page but the fact is most of the updates today are degenerating the pages obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage and too bad you did not quit a year ago i might still be here and there would probably be several thousands of lines and few hundred articles more along with maybe more photographs good riddance',1

crown of ptolemy hi there methychroma i just went and briefly looked over your draft of the crown of ptolemy article wppjtf has been working towards and since there is such a large backlog on articles for review i wanted to give you some advice so it passes quickly and easily on the first try you might want to remove the second references section if you can find any other references and doublecheck that all your references meet wikipedia is citation guidelines that would be really great citing the short story itself could also be good easy bib could help if you do not actually own a copy the category short stories does not exist it could be an idea to remove that category from the draft very minor though also make sure the page is categorized somehow under rick riordan check out categoryrick riordan to see how similar articles have been done see if you can get the plot section shortened at all and made more general so outsiders who do not know the series can understand it more easily put more wikilinks in the plot section and make sure the page is welllinked to pages like the kane chroniclesmain characters and applicable percy jackson pages see if you can get a picture of the cover uploaded and put into the article there may also be a rick riordan interview or some such that could provide you with info to make a section about the story is production or some online reviews for reception try kirkus common sense media and here this is actually the most important suggestion i have because the notability that comes from a novel is realworld reception is most important for an article under review i am sure you have already done most of these things but i just wanted to help you catch anything you did miss good luck and in case i forgot to say it looks really great',0

and died november th not because her ability to manage to over throw her husband peter the third but because of her accomplishments expanding russian borders her desire to spread enlightenment through her homeland and her love of the arts like any great leader catherine realized in order to become a major player in the european trade industry she must spread her empire far beyond its limits although she knew the implications if she were to fail she advanced on she defeated the ottoman empire which was said to be the turks greatest loss she expanded her country more than miles giving her empire more ties to european art and culture catherine often referred to herself as the \xe2\x80\x9cdespot of enlightenment\xe2\x80\x9d this was due to her on going pursue of knowledge for herself and for her country she did this by writing a series of educational manuals for the russian youth although this was an important accomplishment in itself her greatest educational contribution to russia was the smolny institute for young noble women which became the most profound school of its time catherine was a patron of the arts and obtained an enormous collection which is known as the hermitage collection occupied the entire winter palace residence of the russian tsars her influence became so wide spread that many various french writers wrote about her including voltaire calling her the \xe2\x80\x9cstar of the north\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe semiramis russia',0

you neatly avoided the issue of wfcc which you raised it makes no difference whether or not those text logos are official they are not used in any capacity on the uniforms or in the venues of the teams in question and thus cannot serve as equivalent replacements for the logo that millions of people have been exposed to over decades and have come to recognize as the identifier of the school is teams the text logo might be used solely on the letterhead of the various team sports for all we know but it certainly is not used by the teams themselves and thus does not serve the encyclopedic purpose of serving as an identifier for them it is pretty disingenuous to suggest that any encyclopedia other than one manipulated by a few people who simply enjoy being disruptive would ever have an article about usc football basketball etc without providing the primary logo used by those teams but i guess that is why my professors laugh when anyone asks if using wikipedia as a reliable source is acceptable and thanks to people like the two i have dealt with here i guess they will always be laughing when students ask that question congrats on perpetuating the stereotype',0

ikke noget at tale om there will probably be more discussions about this in the future but let is leave it there for now however i find this discussion interesting as according to my personal experience stockholm with its isolated location in the middle of sweden rarely relates itself to denmark or copenhagen we do not hear more from denmark than do people in say london paris or berlin in contrast danes always near sweden tend to bother much more about its northern neighbour of historical reasons finns tend to behave similarly regarding sweden it might be interesting for the article maybe the culture section to explain this after all stockholm is only official raison d\xc3\xaatre is to be the capital of sweden but locally there is sort of a subculture trying to develop an identity independent from this for example stockholm tend to be obsessed by its own local history svstockholmiana and one of the most striking thing that occur to tourists must be the historical pretensions of the city notwithstanding most fa\xc3\xa7ades with their beige plaster are in fact much younger than buildings in an average european city its symptomatic the new moderna museet was wellreceived in stockholm because it merged with the neighbourhood whilst a new museum in copenhagen is celebrated if it gets international attention ie arken maybe just some spacedout thoughts of mine',0

macedonians hi realek sorry if i did not awnser yesterday but you seemed a bit angry with me so i decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down now passing to your last message let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections now i will try to awnser your points tito is actions had a number of important consequences for the macedonians the most important was obviously the promotion of a distinctive macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of yugoslavia the process of ethnogenesis gained momentum and a distinct national macedonian identity was formed the first part was already there tito is actions had a number of important consequences for the macedonians the most important was obviously the promotion of a distinctive macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of yugoslavia as for the second part the process of ethnogenesis gained momentum and a distinct national macedonian identity was formed i admit responsability but i only wanted to mean that the birth of the srom represented the completition of the formation of a macedonian national identity not that macedonians were invented in an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of macedonian nationalism like misirkov and delchev if you want to put it better feel free to do it greek macedonians are actually an ethnic group i think you know quite well how i feel about this as i clearly stated it in the talk page but sometimes compromises are necessary and after all it is only stated that greek macedonians live in macedonia not that they represent an ethnic group and it does seem that the greeks who live in macedonia call themselves macedonianslike those that live in crete call themselves cretans tito separated yugoslav macedonia from serbia i think you must have wrongly interpreted this i simply thought it meant that macedonia was administratively separated from serbia under whose control in the kingdom of serbia before and that of yugoslavia after it had been there was no resentment towards the bulgarian repression during the beginning of the bulgarian occupation of the region by removing that sentance honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me but i can not help noting now that the statement is unsourced personally i do not know how macs reacted to bulgarian occupation after all my field is ancient not modern macedonia in conclusion remember that i only edited telex is text without adding new statements in my view the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the macedonians were invented in is in collecting good strong sources for example to make some names danforth is macedonian question or poulton is who are the macedonians as for telex you should remember that it is a wiki rule to not bite newbies telex is a very recent that is among us only since april and is clearly not a nationalist but a honest editor who is striving to be npov if you believe to see bias in his editing remember that every single editor here me included obviously has his pov and it is a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing this is why wikipedia has great possibilities because our bias are emended by the work of others sorry this was so long ciao',0

hi and thank you for your contribution to wikipedia in this case in the chordate article i think you misunderstood the text a little the tetra is actually a bonefish what is unusual is that it has a largely transparent body whence we can see the backbone inside the living animal i do not think this is very common among bone fishes at least not in adult ones am i wrong i can understand that this was possible to misunderstand since image was so dark that you hardly saw the backbone unless you enlarged it therefore i changed the image to one which hopefully illustrates the idea better thanks again for your edit if you had not done that i had not looked carefully at the image and had not changed it i hope you will go on to edit the articles when you feel that you may improve them best regards',0

categoryneocreationism i have just been attempting a cleanup of the categorycreationism hierarchy and i noticed that categoryneocreationism only has neocreationism and a bunch of articles on id in it would it be worth while merging it into categoryintelligent design strictly speaking id should be a subcat of neocreo but that would seem to be rather a tailwagging the dog approach i thought i would raise the idea here before putting it up at wpcfd talkstalk',0

what would make you think that would be supported by many users here multiple people have pointed out that storms draft is unnaceptable at best i said it was better than jed is version but since many problems with it have been pointed out not only does it violate npov by making way too many opinions stated as facts but giving that much space in the article to a view clearly shown to be the minority also violates npov by giving it undue weight just for specifics the source of tritium is still unknown although it clearly result from a nuclear reaction that is initiated within the apparatus clearly unusual nuclear processes are occurring in material where none should occur in spite of these well documented and replicated observations pov in contrast other prestigious journals such the japanese journal of applied physics continue to publish well done studies on the subject it has already been discussed that the peer reviewed status of the citations in sotrms draft is very weak compared to other areas of science so yes this is just another example of trying to tilt the pov towards pro cf talk',0

dumb question would the repeal of withholding via constitutional amendment apply only to fed income taxes that is to say would the states be bound to repeal withholding as well since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place i may have missed it inside the article which is very good indeed and if i did i apologize but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer simply put a dollar represents a unit of freedom and if the phrase a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush has any truth to it at all it means political power is being leveraged indeed heavily back to the consumerproducer for every dollar he keeps that is an extremely compelling argument it seems though hardly ever mentioned regards',0

cory wattenberger despite what many might think the badassness of cory wattenberger is well known across hundreds of nations all over the world the badassness of cory wattenberger has been around for several centuries and has a very important meaning in the lives of many it would be safe to assume that the badassness of cory wattenberger is going to be around for a long time and have an enormous impact on the lives of many people social cultural factors the badassness of cory wattenberger has a large role in american culture many people can often be seen taking part in activities associated with the badassness of cory wattenberger this is partly because people of most ages can be involved and families are brought together by this generally a person who displays their dislike for the badassness of cory wattenberger may be considered an outcast economic factors it is not common practice to associate economics with the badassness of cory wattenberger generally the badassness of cory wattenberger would be thought to have no effect on our economic situation but there are in fact some effects the sales industry associated with the badassness of cory wattenberger is actually a billion dollar a year industry and growing each year the industry employs nearly people in the united states alone it would be safe to say that the badassness of cory wattenberger play an important role in american economics and should not be taken for granted environmental factors after a three month long research project i have been able to conclude that the badassness of cory wattenberger does not negatively effect the environment at all a the badassness of cory wattenberger did not seem to result in waste products and could not be found in forests jungles rivers lakes oceans etc in fact the badassness of cory wattenberger produced some positive effects on our sweet little nature political factors oh does the badassness of cory wattenberger ever influence politics last year candidates running for some sort of position used the badassness of cory wattenberger as the primary topic of their campaign a person might think the badassness of cory wattenberger would be a bad topic to lead a campaign with but in fact with the social and environmental impact is has this topic was able to gain a great number of followers these candidates went for on winning their positions conclusion the badassness of cory wattenberger seem to be a much more important idea that most give credit for next time you see or think of the badassness of cory wattenberger think about what you just read and realize what is really going on it is likely you under valued the badassness of cory wattenberger before but will now start to give the credited needed and deserved footnotes the badassness of cory wattenberger researched in wikipedia the badassness of cory wattenberger dictionarycom',0

since consensus was to keep and i still felt strongly that the lack of web accessibility was a problem i added spans into the list of rphrases then converted the rphrase template to include a link into the list only to discover that the link target shadows the title attribute for tooltip purposes to resolve this i created redirects into the list with verbose titles like r explosive when dry templaterphrase now links to the list via these redirects and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip that way you get your tooltip and i get webaccessibility i hope this makes sense to you if ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each rphrase and i think you could with expanded information on the nature of the hazard standards for storage transport and use and a list of chemicals to which the rphrase applies then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article or retarget the redirect at the article either way you will not have to touch the templates hesperian',0

gaulish language the answer to your question in gaulish language is that the socalled vulgar latin which should be called a latinized italoceltic idiom instead because the spoken language of the romans oscoumbrian or sabellic language and not latin already essentially a written language the protoitalian was so similar to the continental celtic languages that only the lexicon and the pronunciation differed a bit and could almost be considered a dialect of gaulish as it contained the same substratum unlike the insular celtic languages so in reality no one can assert that gaulish is an extinct language because we do not know enough about it before the roman conquest and probably many latin words were already used by the gauls before their first contact with the conquerers at the most assimilation could better describe what happened to that language both the protoitalics and the protocelts veneti originally come from the bellbeaker culture and lived in a dialect continuum for a long time in fact celtic is more a culture brought by a thracocimmerian aristocracy than a language family except for brythonic and gaelic languages which are both quite different from each other because of their respective substratum as mentionned above moreover protoenglish or protofrisian spoken by the belgae was already used in britain as well as in some parts of northern gaul gallia belgica by the time of the roman invasion then the belgic tribes just kept speaking the same language during and after the roman time',0

and what do quanta and cosmology have in common energy to simply categorize physics as the study of everything is imperceptive when modeling sand falling into a pile or nuts sorting in a jar a physicist does not really care about the identity of the particles at hand just certain bulk properties that relate to its energetics the chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities but then usually is not capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it is shaken or spilled a physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper just that it is and chemists do not just care about chemical elements and compounds there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons nuclear chemistry still matter as a point of culture chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy and how that affects matter physical chemists very nicely bridge this they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied while the duality may sound a bit contrived there is definitely some truth to the statements and while not perfect it is more meaningful than what is there now',0

more or less have you done the research for me i worry that these tools have rapidity yes but might not make it any easier to judge the recent history of edits thus they can miss that the preceding series of edits might be bad as they focus on just the latest edit or the latest editor i have seen a number of times where simply reverting the latest most obvious bad edit actually restores another vandal is bad edits thus i slog along my watchlist checking recent histories manually do any of the tools allow an adjustable window of recent history with the view to making it easier to find the better point to revert back to i am wasting time yet finding things missed using the simplistic tools i am wishing not to have to sample each of the tools to find what is dissatisfying regarding this aspect i was hoping for some revelation like oh i use this because it is a good fit to the high rate of vandalism but for a broader review use whaletail to slap em down sigh can you point out any reviews of the tools',0

for andrewa string is vernacular embedded in our business from the catalogues of the original manufacturers the last people interested in logic or organology and later folk nomenclature never scholarly nomenclature the same holds for the bc rich company is catalogue referring to its coursed instrument as the string guitar any instrument with at least one nonsingle string should use course for clarity by any serious musicologist intruments with single strings should be termed stringed guitars rather than the string guitar because there is no one string guitar with the definitive article i suggest you start a new article and title it stringed guitars under which you differentiate the various types under subheadings accordign to their number of courses the baroque guitar would fall under course the bc rich instrument would fall under course i suggest a nonguitarist baroque lutenist should mediate this and offer an opinion on the established musicological use of the terms course and string we must recognise that string guitar is an exception to and deviation from a wellestablished musicologicalorganological convention and not the rule according to which we should rewrite the terminology we should also recognise that the term string guitar enters not via musicologists or scholars but via guitar manufacturers and was later taken up mainly by folk musicians in contrast there is an extensive scholarly history of referring to instruments with at least one pair of strings as coursed not single strungstringed now i am not suggesting renaming string guitars but it is a mistake and folly to try to oppose centuriesold scholarly conventions and to take the exception as the rule and rewrite the terminology of organology',0

albanians descendants of the illyrians albanians descendants of the illyrians the earliest attempt to link the modern albanians to the ancient illyrians was made in by the swedish historian hans erich thunman in his book untersuchungen ueber die geschichte der oestlichen europaischen voelker research on the history of eastern european peoples using roman and byzantine historical sources as well as linguistic and onomastic evidence thunman was able to conclude that the albanians were the autochthon descendants of the ancient illyrian populations who were never romanized like the dacothracian populations forefathers of the romanians austrian linguist johannes georges von hahn further supported the theory of the illyrian origin of albanians in his work albanesische studien albanian studies in in the course of time many other historians archeologists and linguists have provided further arguments supporting the theory that the albanians and their language are modern day descendants of the illyrians albanians live in the territories once inhabited historical sources pointing to the movement become settlers of these territoriesthere are no historical sources pointing to the movement of albanians from elsewhere to become settlers of these territories components of illyrian linguistic elements such as names of objects tribes names of people etc known can be found in the albanian language one of the latest attempts in this ongoing effort to establish a link between these civilizations is a book entitled ancient illyria recently published in londonit is a study of unpublished documents and includes the book illyrian letters written by the renowned archeologist sir arthur evans this work sheds light on the society and the culture of these predecessors of albanians the relationships of albanian with ancient greek and latin testify that albanian was formed and developed alongside these two languages along the shores of the adriatic and the ionian seasin dhimiter kamarda published his linguistic study saggio di grammatologia comparata della lingua albanese showing its antiquity as well as attempting to demonstrate its close relationship to greek even according to the writers of ancient greece illyrians and epirotes did not differ from each other in any way they lived and were like the modern albanians without any differencetoskeri is the southern part of albania its northern counterpart is known as gegeri they spoke the language which we speak today ibid p in antiquity herodotus wrote that epirus is inhabited by nongreek peoples who speak a barbarian languagein antiquity greeks used this term to refer to foreigners indeed it was this nongreek language which was later going to be one of the distinguishing elements setting the albanians apart from other nationalities of the balkan peninsula',0

the aim of this article and any other wikipedia article is that it accurately reflect reliably sources since intelligent design is a fringe subject it is also important that we do not present it as it were mainstream science there are atheists and even a few agnostics that considered id a viable hypothesis long before the discovery institute was founded so the use of the word all in the opening paragraph is just petty and wrong well no all of the major proponents do appear to be associated with the di no one is arguing that there were no id proponents before the di existed but as far as we can glean from reliable sources they all ended up associated with the di if you have sources that suggest otherwise please let us know we can only work off of reliable sources there is nothing petty about it there is truth and there is opinion you have written a fine opinion piece two things one of that truth is not something we can work with we need reliable sources i can know that something is true but if i do not have a reliable source to support that fact it does not belong in wikipedia that said on what basis do you consider this an opinion piece are the sources misrepresented are there reliable sources that are not represented that does nothing to support or defend evolution again it is not our place to support or defend anythingwhat are the facts that support id vs evolution i think we would all like to know the answer to that question i have not actually come across any are you aware of any reliable sources that discuss any i do not believe that there are any congratulations you are zealots in the evolution religion er yeah if you want anyone to take you seriously you should not accuse people of people zealots or of belonging to some nonexistent religion seriously provide some sources to support your position let us know if we are missing any notable perspectives on the issue let us know if we are missing relevant sources let us know if any sources are misrepresented we are willing to listen but not to silliness like this',0

exo interestingly enough i have added such a section and have since added the stats in a more neutral edit in the kinect section of the article my edit as follows xbox one gets to know you it learns what you like and what you don\xe2\x80\x99t and brings it all together on your own personal home screen and because every xbox one comes with kinect it responds naturally to your voice movements and gestures the xbox one kinect can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes for a seamless gaming experience the kinect sensor detects when you are smiling crying angry or bored every detail of your face is recorded to gain an insight into your likely mood even your heartbeat is measured and your motions can be seen in the dark i have worked on several versions of this and our self titled edit dictator has been telling me it is not neutral or that i am implying something then he changes his argument to saying that i am duplicating information how is information duplicated when what i add is not there in the first place you my friend are well advised to spread the word about the bias and censorship here that is especially prevalent in the xbox one article spread the word bias is used to remove pertinent information dissentcriticism is silenced and you are told that you are the one not being neutral when adding to the article last time i checked almost every major article on wikipedia has not just links to it is subtopics but either short clips or brief summaries from the subtopic article pages added into the main article apparently here in xbox one it is different double standards continue to be enforced and trust me this information is neutral these are facts exo',0
highking your closure of that ani report is unwise at best abusive at worst ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided maybe not with respect to the bi sanction but even that is not clear cut given it is meant to be broadly construed but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction but on a slightly different bi related term action is clearly warranted archived or not as i said i am not going to let this lie i will be informing cailil when he returns in addition to sanctioning highking i expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with highking is behaviour and what he should be avoiding who i am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not highking is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour cailil described as being not wanted here he even made that exact point to highking while cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reportsdisputes has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from highking i know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with highking and i can see why with actions like this your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect rewarding highking for bad edits it is really no skin off my nose is it if i am a banned user do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me or if i am not banned but this is just not my main account then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason i might have for not posting there with my main account of course not the only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue which given the fact cailil was at pains to point out that highking is poor behaviour stretches back to is not a good thing for wikipedia you are an admin you are expected to deal with long term problems not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons if highking were ever to end up at arbitration for example do you think he would escape sanction for persistent wpte behaviour simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like wpsock of course not hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin you being the person who maintains that cycle of wpte is not only bad for wikipedia it is a form of laxity that really is not excused by who i may or may not be it also had the material effect of me not being able to correct murray on a basic point of fact meaning the archive now has errors in it which i am sure is not the intent of that facility archive or no archive at the very least if or more likely when cailil sanctions highking for those edits i expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on wikipedia anyway i have probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete so goodbye for now',0

wikipedia is not censored i feel a diagram as you suggest does not do the job of a photograph take a look at any fine medical textbook there you will find plenty of what many consider disturbing photographs i do not know that the juvenile claim can be verified i know a woman well into her twenties with a similar looking vagina it seems appropriate to have a picture without pubic hair since it offers a better view of vaginal anatomy wikipedia is written collaboratively by volunteers from all around the world visitors do not need specialised qualifications to contribute since their primary role is to write articles that cover existing knowledge this means that people of all ages and cultural and social backgrounds can write wikipedia articles nd and rd paragraph it would be great however if a gynecologist were to contribute this may be falsely assuming that they have not it seems that it would be an honor to any contributor if teenagers were to come on here to learn about vaginas this seems far better than going to questionable pornography sites that are just as available',0

the intentmeaning of the book and film the supplmental material on the bluray disk includes reminiscences from melvyn douglas is granddaughter about the making of the film it is obvious she has no idea whatever what the film is about the film is meaning is futher confused by ashby is introduction of the walking on water scene which is not in the book and which he makes sure we get by having chance thrust his umbrella into the lake it is unfortunate that the film like chance has become a kind of inkblot onto which people project their own interpretations when it should be obvious to any reasonably intelligent person what kosinsky is getting at the book does not explain the story either kosinski had too much respect for the reader to do that but it goes something like this chance is a voyeur who has never actually experienced anything directly everything he knows is a vicarious experience from watching tv and because his mind is filled with nothing other than what he sees on tv he has never developed an inner dialog that might provide some framework into which he could place his experiences',0

i think the enhanced peruser perarticle protection blocking feature is the answer that goes a long way to satisfy my concerns and i am pleasantly surprised it seems to be one of the most popular proposals on meta at the moment it would mean we could do a full block for hours sufficient to cool down then block on talk user talk space for hours to prove they really are committed to writing the encyclopedia and not just sniping at people we can then counteract criticism like oh but they are such a good content creator with well they are not blocked from creating content so what is your point talk cont',0

hi again i really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel the reason is just that as the acceleration is slow you have to wait a long time and travel a long way to reach high speed at a uniform acceleration a you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to v sqrt as in newtonian approximation which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach then s v a and for a given v s gets very large if a is small but since the intensity of sunlight decreases like s with distance from the sun a does not remain constant but drops rapidly making things very much worse once you get out to well beyond the orbit of pluto where the sun begins to look like a very bright star the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant as well as the cosmic background radiation which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight finally there is the problem that at really high speeds the light of the sun would begin to be red shifted so you lose power from that effect too some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship with a huge power station a trillion watts say near the earth and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship then as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship is sail you could get constant acceleration a calculation i did years ago which i will not try to reproduce now suggested to me that speeds of maybe c could conceivably be reached in this manner which is very exciting \xe2\x80\x94 but then somehow you have to stop for example if i recall if the aperture of the beaming mirror is r the ship sail dia r the distance from the sun d and the wavelength \xce\xbb then you need \xce\xbbr rd and acceleration g will get you to c in years at a distance d of light years cm which makes the mirror r km in diameter for a sail r km with a um \xce\xbb nb the mirror needs to be optically perfect to \xce\xbb but the sail does not of course c is a useful speed and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer with a fusion rocket to stop but the trillion watt figure i remember was for a fairly small ship or tons if i recall and i think a nuclearelectric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of or tons i cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go though possibly competitive with other approaches what i personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint considering all approaches producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best tradeoff solution with current technology right now the trip time for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet would probably last a thousand years or more so in ten or thirty years we should redo the study and see how that number has changed due to technological advances at some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star or something equally revolutionary anyhow only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies which would depend on the rate of technology change would it be sensible to start a serious program with what nasa would call a phase a study leading to a program start then a preliminary design review and then a critical design review which is when you can start cutting metal solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the solar system though i think nuclearelectric ion drives are likely to prove better the latter can certainly take us all over the solar system in the time scales of the great explorations of the th and th centuries then in years the solar system will be ours and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars possibly minisolar systems like jupiter its moons if such systems are common we might find useful places to go only as far as alpha centauri which would change everything and the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now sorry i have been inattentive to wikipedia for a month or two due to other responsibilities which may increase or diminish in',0

do not see the point of linking husband profile to her page as he is not a public figure i have seen other pages like george yeo is spouse listed but never seen her corporaterolesprofile linked removed the same link as it talked about marriage but link has nothing to do with marriage removed a temasek review article stating she dumped her boyfriend for her husband because it is baseless as strictly speaking there was no evidence taking photos together does not mean boyfriend so do not see a point in inserting your the new paper article of her refuting the claims removed the youtube link as i was told there is copyrights involved also related to you seem to want to to include comments made by pm lee about tpl i do not see the point so may i know each time a minister talks about tpl are you going to write it in i have made those edits to shorten the article it was too lengthy too many quotes i do not see the point of including her treasurer post in th council when i have updated her role in th thanks for blocking me',0
free software example i am not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the traditional ip model is as strong as it could be as far as i can see the standard argument for ip protection is not that it is the only way that people can innovate but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it the fact that works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives does not in itself contradict the standard ip model for such criticism to be very strong you would have to show not only that direct financial incentives are not always required but also that direct financial incentives do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases in other words the standard ip model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist it just says that you will get more overall innovation with ip protection that you would without it listing counterexamples without also discussing their wider significance does not in itself invalidate the incentives to innovate argument it would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that',0

hey ddv you are just stirring around the elements emphatically making an awfully lengthy show but proving nothing you can not call an ancient egyptian a black man and keep a straight face can you have you studied it at all and i mean outside of the propaganda site bibliographies egyptology is a respectable field but people like you make a circus out of it your arguments are shifty imbalanced and halting trying to prove your point for example by indicating an article as if it should be taken for sooth in an encyclopedia you openly proclaim racist not to mention published before world war i is ridiculous in the real definition of that word worthy of ridicule the same with referencing historical commentaries long removed from actual events to prove egyptians were black men when we have real egyptian records and artifacts to examine herodotus a reliable source on eighteenth dynasty egypt hello i can not say i understand the impulse egypt was a repetative place always the same sculptures always the same rituals always the same supplications always the same monuments to egos in stone its colonnades inspired later architects in greece and rome but for all its monumentality egyptian architecture was not worth much more than that is it because you suppose egypt was the first real civilization look up ancient sumer all the while the heart of the world is africa we evolved there as a species erectus to sapiens after that we diverged biodiversity environmental adaptation and now we are a little differently hued standing next to each other and of slightly different skeleton why should that not make us brothers',0

johnbod i am unclear as to what you are complaining about what specifically is the pov that you see here i originally would have agreed with haldraper but i think it is not quite so cutanddried as liberal land reformers against oligarchical private landowners and the church as a landowner sometimes the regimes targeted all the land owners secular and clerical other times they targeted just the church the church was not only targeted because it owned land but because they controlled all aspects of society ie from marriage to baptism to last rites and burial on church grounds secular reformers saw this as a stranglehold whereby the church could get anything it wanted not just from owning land but by controlling who could marry have a legitimate child or even die within the church the church was also targeted because it tended to support the landowners in a conservative alliance finally the church was targeted by a number of revolutionary regimes because it had supported the spanish monarchy against the rebels you can not really blame them but it does not help to have supported losing side',0

if canada abolished the monarchy or changed the succession rules it would have no impact on the uk conversely if the uk were to change its succession rules and canada maintained the status quo we would be faced with the possibility of having to completely change our system to accomodate a resident monarchy when our political system and constitution are not designed for an absentee monarch hence the position of governor general which does not exist in the uk tab the british monarchy is first among equals in political terms as the abolition of the monarchy in canada australia new zealand etc would have no impact on the monarchy in britain whereas the abolition of the monarchy in the uk would almost certainly lead to its extinction in the rest of the commonwealth realms the fact is that the system in the commonwealth realms outside of the uk was designed with the assumption that the monarch would be resident in london do you deny thattab the fact is that the monarch is present most of the time in britain she has spent of her reign in canada and i suspect around that percentage or less in the other commonwealth realmstab the fact is that this means there is quite a different relationship between the monarch and a her british subjects and the british political system and b her subjects and the political systems in the other commonwealth realms the most obvious constitutional difference is that the duties and constitutional role played by the governor general in the commonwealth realms is played by the queen herself in britain ie the queen with increasingly rare exceptions does not give royal assent to bills passed in commonwealth legislatures or even give the throne speech what in britain is called the queen is speech because the queen herself gives it she does not name the prime ministers in commonwealth realms does not resolve constitutional or parliamentary crises that may result in commonwealth realms and does not have weekly meetings with her commonwealth pmstab now monarchists like to believe that the queen is fully informed and intimately involved in let is say canadian affairs the reality is that in the commonwealth realms the role of the monarchy has developed so that it is really more of an abstract and theoretical entity much more so than in britaintab let me give you a hard example we now know that the queen was not at all consulted on the dismissal of gough whitlam in australia in this was done by governor general kerr in her name but she was not consulted or even informed until after it had happenedtab let me give you another example we now know thanks to the year disclosure rule that the prince philip and the prince of wales quite regularly write letters and make phone calls to cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats in britain complaining of this or that government policy this is actually quite shocking considering all the propaganda we are fed about the monarchy being above politics we also know from biographies and autobiographies that uk prime ministers do give some consideration to what the queen thinks about this or that thing or even this or that minister it may not be a decisive consideration but its in the picture that is simply not the case for commonwealth realm pms there is no evidence of royals writing canadian or austrlain ministers complaining about this or that policy or of canadian or australian pms being particularly concerned about what the queen might think at least not to the extent as is the case in the uk tab now you might say but the governor general acts on hms behalf so there is really no difference but there is the queen is role in the uk is unmediated in the realms it is mediated by a gg and she is almost a complete absentee from the processtab therefore it is quite clear that her role is much more important in the uk than elsewhere also the fact that the systems in the commonwealth realms are designed with an absentee monarch in mind and have a gg in place britain becoming a republic would have an impact on the realms where commonwealth realms becoming republics has had no impact on the queen is role in the uk the fact is if britain became a republic the commonwealth realms would have to figure out which one of them would become the new home for the windsors or if some sort of shared custody arrangement should be worked out where say she spends one month in each realmtab the fact is they would also have to deal with the royal family is wishes including the possibility that they would not want to move to canada or australia but would prefer to either remain in a british republic as ordinary citizens or live in exile in europe or even the us that would raise the possibility of abdication and having to find a new mon',0

just because a man says i haveaxe eg i have no axe to grind does not mean that he is threatening you with personal violence then or that later ifwhen he has an axe that he is threatening to take it to a grinding wheel and then attack you or that he is threatening to use an axe or knife or hatchet or anything on you etc if that is what you get out of that phrase or every time the word \xe2\x80\x9caxe\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccut\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chammer\xe2\x80\x9d etc is spoken or written you find yourself worried or uncomfortable i think that you should discuss these concerns with someone you trust the persons you trust can discuss these concerns with you andor direct you to others with whom you can discuss these concerns further people including you commonly use even more colorful expressions and lingo without the slightest intent to threaten someone at least we all hope you are not intending to be threatening when you make commentds including an axehttpenwikipediaorgwikitalkqueenband if people are responding to you when you say these things in a manner that indicates that they are taking what you say as a threat you may wish to discontinue saying such things and candidly even all the more so if you are actually intending to make a threat if you are concerned that a particular phase that you feel has been directed at you is a threat and you believe that you are in some danger then the only responsible advice anyone can give to you is for you to contact the appropriate police authorities and report it to them my personal opinion that you are completely wrong does not matter it is an issue for you of safety it is better that you bother the law enforcement authorities with matters that were not a threat to you but that you felt were a threat than to fail to report a real threat for fear that you are overreacting they will either provide you the help you need or arrange for that help it may be that you are overreacting or reading more into what someone says it may be that the help you need is not exactly of the type you think you might need all that can be worked out in time what is important first is that you are actually safe what is really going on in the messages that you are reading is something that if you are truly concerned for your safety can be sorted out later for your safety online you should never give out your name your home address the addresses of your friends or family your phone number your friends or family is phone numbers your personal email address or any anyone else is email address the name of your city or town your school or work name or address the names of any teams or clubs you belong to any passwords you have or know you can get more suggestions for safe use of the internet at many different siteshttpwwwbesafeonlineorgenglishnewsgroupshtm httpteenadviceaboutcomlibraryweeklyaa ahtm ttpwwwslidesharenetbarrowvian rulesforsafeinternetusage',0

relisting of evidence that safavids were turkic speakers tajik since you have ignored the numerous references which we bring and constantly are trying to purge out the word turkic from safavid page let me bring you some more summarized quotes many of these may be already on this talk page it is just some people choose to ignore them and uphold their own pov the establishment of the gajar capital in tehran at the end of the eighteenth century was merely the last manifestation of what may well be a permanent tendency in the life of iran there are manifold reason of this phenomenon moreover the turkish and mongol origins of the earliest dynasties certainly played a major part in causing the capitals to be situated in the north and especially along the main invasion route following alburz into azarbaijan the princes of these basically nomadic states were anxious both to be near their tribes and to avoid the excessive heat of the climate farther to the south this helps to explain the evolution of tabriz which despite all the vicissitudes was the capital successively of the mongols the qara qoyunlu the aq qoyunlu and finally the safavids all of whom stemmed originally from the turkmen tribes of the northwest from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries tabriz was abandoned only for short periods and always for other cities in the same region maragheh whose fertile pasture land had attracted hulagu ardabil the cradle of the safavids and sultaniyeh the cambridge history of iran in eight volumes volume the land of iran edited by wbfisher cambridge at the university press page the origins of the safavids are clouded in obscurity they may have been of kurdish origin see r savory iran under the safavids p r matthee safavid dynasty at iranicacom but for all practical purposes they were turkishspeaking and turkified their eponymous ancestor safialdin was a disciple of shaikh zahed of gilan a sunnite sufi pir or spiritual leader safialdin succeeded his pir and settled in ardabil in eastern azerbaijan and founded the safavid order he was buried there and his tomb and the citybecame a place of pilgrimage for his devotees in the course of time and under the leadership of safialdin is descendents the order became a militant shiite one with golat or extremist features receiving support from turkish and turkmen tribes in azerbaijan and eastern anatolia such as the shamlu ostajlu takallu d\xc2\xa8ulqadr qajar and afshar tribes who had strong devotional ties to the heads of the order the oldest poet of azeri literature known so far and indubitably of azeri not east anatolian or khorasani origin is emadaldin nasimi about \xe2\x80\x93 qv other important azeri poets were shah esmail safawi khatai \xe2\x80\x93 and fozuli about \xe2\x80\x93 qv an outstanding azeri poet during th \xe2\x80\x93 th centuries a rich azeri literature continued to flourish but classical persian exercised great influence on the language and literary expression on the other hand many azeri words about entered persian still more in kurdish since iran was governed mostly by azerispeaking rulers and soldiers since th century doerfer these loanwords refer mainly to administration titles and conduct of war shah abbas ii r \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 qv was himself a poet writing turkic verse with the pen name of tani the zands were an iranian people and their decades of dominance were one of the few periods between the arrival of the salj\xc5\xabqs and the twentieth century during which effective political power was exercised by a dynasty that can be regarded as in some sense ethnically persian david morgan medieval persia history of the near east isbn with the exception of some very local dynasties the zands were the only iranian dynasty that had come to power since the buyids in the th century the azeri turks are shiites and were founders of the safavid dynasty thanks',0

dear federico when i have the time and i promise i will make the time i will delete any true ad hominem remarks dense would be a good example not only do they not belong on wikipedia but as a student of logic it is a classic logical fallacy to use an ad hominem remark to form an argument but as i said i feel passionately about the subject and it has brought out the worst in me however certain comments i will not remove a claim of hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark it is a statement that one is views are contradictory that proposes one standard for one case and another standard for another as such hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark rather it is used to describe inconsistent statements or behaviour for example you mention that you have to show me where the statistics of historians\xe2\x80\x99 opinions about hiroshima and nagasaki decision is does it include soviet historians japanese historians chinese historians south american historians east and west european historians africans historians arab indian historians or only include us army historians even in that case opinion of the majority is still opinion not fact fair enough but later on you say it is been stated many times that the americans were only thinking of saving american lives through the abomb the japanese never came into it they did not care at all about japanese lives so your reasoning is invalid who said this you impose such high criteria for my statement that the abomb saved human lives requiring experts from all over the world but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because it is been stated many times stated many times by who according to your very own criteria you need to provide evidence from soviet historians japanese historians chinese historians south american historians east and west european historians africans historians arab and indian historians but you do not you merely state it is been stated many timestherefore my reasoning is invalid apparently loomis has to provide sources but we can take federico is word for it whatever he says that my dear friend is hypocrisy and you my dear friend are a hypocrite for reasoning in such a way calling you a hypocrite is therefore not an ad hominem remark and i therefore will not remove it and by the way thank you for pointing out my typo when i put a k in the word recognize again it seems that when loomis makes the slightest spelling typo its fair game to point it out but when federico makes numerous spelling grammar syntactical etc mistakes its impolite to recognize and show sensitivity towards the fact that english is not federico is first language i have more to say but unfortunately i have an appointment hopefully i will get back in time to finish this before you read it in the mean time i truly mean it when i say that i consider myself a softspoken agreeable person is not all this mea culpa proof on anything speak to you later and all the best',0

actually i do not think it is particularly enlightening at all first the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from the same person i view that implication as an example of a strawman argument a person builds up an intentionally weak or flawed argument solely for the purposes of knocking it down that is not particularly enlightening except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they have built it up specially just for that purpose i view the matter more as an example of a commonality of selfselection consider that if you are at the top of el capitan natural rock pillar you will find generally two types of people very rich people who can and do hire a helicopter to fly there very capable enthusiastic and competent rock climbers in other words you do not find there many people who are both poor and handicapped merely because of where you happen to be and if you are actually there chances are that you too are either rich or a very good rock climber wikipedia is quite likely a magnet for control freaks and others obviously i have read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits while i could say get a life i do not view such enthusiasm as inherently bad wrong or a problem but i think there may very well be an association between ocdtype obsessivecompulsive disorder editing and controlfreak behavior there are other clues that must be considered a person who is acting out a controlfreak fantasy wants to control as much as possible apparently wp has made it quite easy to revert to a previous edit that ability is not necessarily bad against vandals but it implicitly encourages a kind of all or nothing reaction if a controlfreak wishes to manipulate as much and as many as possible it is far easier to simply revert all of an edit rather than carefully and selectively remove only as much of a problem as actually exists ever heard an old saying when the only tool you have is a hammer you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails one of the most inefficient routes from the standpoint of a controlfreak is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit and the characteristics of the controlfreak is actions a controlfreak gets his jollies most readily by undoing what others have done the controlfreak feels explicitly or implicitly that he does not have to justify the status of the article before his victim is edit if the control freak must actually distinguish between proper posting and improper posting sections he becomes far less efficient at manipulating others he must spend far more valuable in his notsohumble opinion time reading and distinguishing rather than merely reverting consider a hypothetical war between a person who is making a house of cards and another person who views it as his task to impede the first the latter person needs merely show up for a second or two every few minutes and knock down the house of cards minutes or hours of work is gone in a moment very efficient from the standpoint of the control freak but not for his victim worse if the control freak must first obtain a consensus something which wp ostensibly requires he is powerfully impeded from excercising his controlfreak tendencies i am not considering here raw vandalism of course very arguably it should be easy to completely revert actual genuine vandalism it is not surprising therefore that controlfreaks are far more likely to simply revert all of an edit quickly preventing consensus and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion thus i notice that in so far every case every driveby deletion to which i have been a victim involves a person who reverts all of my edits check and not merely a portion of them check and who does so very quickly check who prevents any sort of consensus from forming check and who does not bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting or the freak is abrupt erasures check aha things are getting quite clear at least from the standpoint of the controlfreak in question but why should a flock of others try criticize the victim and not the control freak is it because i think they are the same person strawman argument noooo consider another saying birds of a feather flock together if there were only a single controlfreak in the world nobody else would have any motivation to assist him or to help victimize his victims but there are many controlfreaks and each understands that if one control freak gets impeded prohibited or criticized or exposed the next one could be them after all i',0

infobox cast listbilling i have noticed that the order of the cast list has been changed several times in the past few weeks mostly moving patrick dempsey andor isaiah washington higher in the list i am guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and pd is mcdreamy is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that pdellen pompeo and iwsandra oh are the two big couples on the show but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of iw and pd at the bottom of the list someone is idea of belittling their roles on the show i doublechecked the order with the most recently aired episode and based on that i switched tr and justin chambers as well as jp jr and kate walsh the credits read with isaiah washington and patrick dempseythat final billing with the preposition with is actually a good thing it reflects upon the actors value to the show i just wanted to add this explanation here so that it could be referenced in case anyone was moved around in the order againmy edit places them in the correct order as billed',0

according to simon schama is book the power of art guernica was painted in response to an article that picaso saw in an french newspaper the first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell he had agreed to do a politically minded painting for a paris fair but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in geurnica unfolded it was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work quite possibly apocryphal i cut this from the article a story quite possibly apocryphal circulates about guernica during world war ii a german officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time in the presence of picasso in a wondering tone he asks picasso did you do this and picasso replies no you did if it is quite possibly apocryphal and we have no attribution or citation it does not belong in the article talk dec utc except that this is extremely widely believed and noted i recall hearing the equivalent when i was at the prado dec utc then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told was guernica ever in the prado in the early s it was in an annex to the prado and then was moved to the reina sofia no talk dec utc duh yeah that is what i meant to say it has been years since i was there yes i would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote dec utc the most specific version i could find as that picasso is supposed to have said this in replying to german ambassador otto abetz as he was visiting picasso is studio then there are versions that have picasso handing out postcards sometimes autographed even to germans while making this quip but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous german officer bringingseeing a postcardphotograph none of these sites mention sources of course but this one has an interesting addition picasso himself probably had contributed to barr is and others perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when immediately following the liberation he told an american correspondent for newsweek magazine that on the day when a german army officer had recognized a sketch of guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him did you do that picasso coldly had replied no you did now the tale originates with picasso himself and is told to newsweek which makes this version much more credible than the others since it is hard to see how a response to abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented while it is equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous german officer could be known at all unfortunately no other site corroborates the newsweek detail i have sent a mail to the newsweek editors and i will keep you posted if someone could check out some picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote and what source they give if any that would be great apr utc we can certainly cite the fact that picasso himself told a possibly apocryphal story it makes the line his even if it is not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances talk apr utc yes if picasso really told it so far no sources are backing up that website or even just repeating that version so i am not too keen on it otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before \xc2\xb7 talk apr utc if anyone is up for some library work old newsweeks are pretty easy to find talk apr utc nudity i reverted this from categorypaintings containing nudity to categorypaintings clearly the fact that one naked female human breast is visible in the painting is a very minor fact about the painting no one by a very weird obsessive would look for it there it is primarily a political work about war i could make a case that it is a perfect illustration that nakedness is not always nudity but i think it suffices to say',0

this is a difficult one if there were a clear example then no doubt the arbcom would have given one despite there being many arbitrators who could have proposed ideas no doubt they were mindful that no suggestion made by the community to date had come close to reaching consensus i am also mindful that a proposal to leave date notation questions to the talk pages of individual articles also failed to gain community consensus largely as there was no appetite to repeat the same arguments over a large number of articles i think a substantial reason for the change would be if it was consistent with a proposal discussed communitywide that gained consensus however i do not see any proposal gaining this consensus at present another reason would be if it were a change that was so obvious that noone would rationally oppose it again i can not think of a reallife example here',0
